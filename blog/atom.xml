        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you need to break complex work into multiple AI tasks, should you use subagents or subrecipes? Learn the key differences and when to use each approach.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Subagents vs Subrecipes" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/subrecipes-vs-subagents-19bca16b86a951e4618be8ab6ce90fb2.png" width="1960" height="1029" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When you're working on complex projects with goose, you'll often need to break work into multiple tasks and run them with AI agents. Goose gives you two powerful ways to do this: <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/experimental/subagents/">subagents</a> and <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/sub-recipes-in-parallel/">subrecipes</a>. Both can run multiple AI instances in parallel, but they work  differently. Picking which one to use can be confusing, so we're going to guide you to a decision.</p>
<p>I've been using both approaches, and the choice between them depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Let me break down when to use each method and show you real examples.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-core-difference-to-re-use-or-not-re-use">The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#the-core-difference-to-re-use-or-not-re-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use" title="Direct link to The Core Difference: To Re-Use or Not Re-Use">​</a></h2>
<p>Subagents are temporary AI instances that you create with natural language in your prompt and tend to be one-off tasks and then disappear.</p>
<p>Subrecipes are pre-written files full of instructions that define reusable workflows you can run repeatedly with customized parameters.</p>
<p>The TL;DR: subagents are for quick, one-off delegation. Subrecipes are for structured, repeatable processes.</p>
<p>Also, both are still in 'experimental' status, so there's always a possibility their features and capabilities will change over time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="subagents-quick-and-flexible">Subagents: Quick and Flexible<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#subagents-quick-and-flexible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subagents: Quick and Flexible" title="Direct link to Subagents: Quick and Flexible">​</a></h2>
<p>Subagents excel when you're in a goose session and just want task delegation without setup overhead. Here's how simple they are to use:</p>

<p>Goose automatically spawns three independent AI instances, and each works on a different component. You get real-time progress tracking and they all work in parallel from that prompt. You're off and running: no setup, no configuration files, just natural language instructions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-makes-subagents-great">What Makes Subagents Great<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#what-makes-subagents-great" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Makes Subagents Great" title="Direct link to What Makes Subagents Great">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick setup with natural language</strong> -- No recipe files to write. Just describe what you want in your prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Process isolation</strong> -- Failures don't affect your main workflow. Each subagent runs independently.</li>
<li><strong>Context preservation</strong> -- Keeps your main chat clean by offloading detailed work to separate instances.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible execution</strong> -- Easy to specify parallel or sequential execution in your prompt.</li>
<li><strong>External integration</strong> -- Can use external AI agents like Codex or Claude Code.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time progress</strong> -- Live monitoring dashboard shows task completion status.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="subagent-limitations">Subagent Limitations<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#subagent-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subagent Limitations" title="Direct link to Subagent Limitations">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited reusability</strong> -- Each subagent is created from scratch. No saved configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Common LLM</strong> -- All subagents share the same LLM model as the parent session.</li>
<li><strong>Tool restrictions</strong> -- Subagents can't manage extensions, they can only use what the main session already had access to before the subagents were launched.</li>
<li><strong>No persistence</strong> -- Configuration isn't saved for future use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="subrecipes-structured-and-reusable">Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#subrecipes-structured-and-reusable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable" title="Direct link to Subrecipes: Structured and Reusable">​</a></h2>
<p>Subrecipes solve the reusability problem. While main "parent" recipes can be in YAML or JSON, subrecipes can only be written in YAML format. These files define structured workflows with parameters, validation, extensions to use, and even allow you to pick a different provider/model to use for the work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High reusability</strong> -- Recipe files can be shared and version controlled across projects.</li>
<li><strong>Structured parameters</strong> -- Type-safe parameter handling with validation and documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Template support</strong> -- Dynamic parameter injection using template syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Full tool access</strong> -- Subrecipes can use any extensions and tools available to goose.</li>
<li><strong>LLM customization</strong> -- Each subrecipe can specify its own LLM model to use.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional logic</strong> -- Smart parameter passing based on conversation context.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow orchestration</strong> -- Complex multi-step processes with dependencies and execution order control.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong> -- Requires careful YAML file creation and parameter definition.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong> -- Need to understand recipe syntax and structure.</li>

<p><strong>Use subagents when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need quick, one-off task delegation</li>
<li>Tasks can be completed independently and don't need to be repeated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use subrecipes when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building reusable workflows you can share with your team</li>
<li>Need structured parameter handling</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="common-benefits-and-limitations-of-both-approaches">Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#common-benefits-and-limitations-of-both-approaches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches" title="Direct link to Common Benefits and Limitations of Both Approaches">​</a></h2>
<p>Both of these features share some limitations. We've already mentioned the experimental and evolving nature, but there are a few more important ones to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subrecipes and subagents run their tasks in isolation and do not share state with one another. This isolation helps prevent conflicts and keeps tasks self-contained. If you do need to share information between the processes, you will have to be very explicit about this in your prompts and instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither can spawn additional similar workers: subagents can't create more subagents, and subrecipes can't call other subrecipes. This prevents runaway processes but limits deep nesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you're using subagents or subrecipes, you can only run up to 10 concurrent parallel workers total. This is not user-configurable, but this limit keeps resource usage manageable; this may limit very large-scale parallelism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started">Getting Started<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#getting-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started" title="Direct link to Getting Started">​</a></h2>
<p>My recommendation: start with subagents to experiment and understand your workflow needs. They're easier to get started with because you don't need to write configuration files first.</p>
<p>Once you identify patterns you want to repeat, you can convert that subagent workflow session into a recipe and subrecipe structure. This gives you the best progression from experimentation to production.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-choice-is-yours">The Choice is Yours<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/26/subagents-vs-subrecipes#the-choice-is-yours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Choice is Yours" title="Direct link to The Choice is Yours">​</a></h2>
<p>The choice depends on your specific needs and workflow requirements. Quick tasks that won't be repeated favor subagents. Complex workflows with multiple steps or customization favor subrecipes.</p>
<p>Your workflow requirements should drive the decision.</p>

<p>Remember when you first learned to cook? You probably started with simple recipes like scrambled eggs or toast. But eventually you wanted to make something more complex, like a full dinner with multiple dishes. That's how subrecipes work in goose: each recipe can run stand-alone for a dedicated task, and a main recipe can orchestrate how they run.</p>
<p>Let's explore <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/sub-recipes-in-parallel">goose subrecipes</a> together! You're about to learn know how to orchestrate multiple AI models, coordinate tasks, and build workflows that will turn you into a "head chef" user with goose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-subrecipes-matter">Why Subrecipes Matter<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#why-subrecipes-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Subrecipes Matter" title="Direct link to Why Subrecipes Matter">​</a></h2>
<p>Think of subrecipes like having a team of specialized chefs in your kitchen. One chef is amazing at making desserts, another excels at grilling, and a third is the salad master. Instead of having one person try to do everything, you let each specialist focus on what they do best.</p>
<p>That's exactly what subrecipes do for your goose workflows. You can have one recipe that's optimized for creative tasks like image generation, another that's perfect for technical documentation, and a third that excels at writing code. Then you orchestrate them all from a main recipe.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-real-world-example-project-setup-automation">A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#a-real-world-example-project-setup-automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation" title="Direct link to A Real-World Example: Project Setup Automation">​</a></h2>
<p>I built a project setup system that creates a complete project with documentation, logo generator, and an initial codebase. Instead of one massive recipe trying to do everything, I broke it into specialized pieces.</p>
<p>Here's the parent recipe that orchestrates everything:</p>

<p>Notice how each subrecipe gets only the parameters it needs, and we can control the execution order in our prompt.</p>
<p>By default, subrecipes run in <em>parallel</em>. This is like having multiple chefs working simultaneously in different parts of the kitchen. The image generation and code writing happen at the same time, cutting your total execution time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need things to happen in order. The best approach here is to list the specific order you want in the recipe instructions. In this example, I want the image and code generation to happen in parallel (because they don't depend on each other), and only run the README generation when the other two steps are both successful so it can reference the generated files.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specialized-subrecipes-for-different-tasks">Specialized Subrecipes for Different Tasks<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#specialized-subrecipes-for-different-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Specialized Subrecipes for Different Tasks" title="Direct link to Specialized Subrecipes for Different Tasks">​</a></h2>
<p>Each subrecipe is optimized for its specific job.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="image-generation-with-openai-dall-e">Image Generation with OpenAI DALL-E<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#image-generation-with-openai-dall-e" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Image Generation with OpenAI DALL-E" title="Direct link to Image Generation with OpenAI DALL-E">​</a></h3>
<p>For the image generation, we could use an image generator MCP system in a smaller recipe. For this example, though, I'm going to have this recipe write a specific script to call OpenAI's DALL-E API directly. This gives me more control over the image generation process and avoids external resources.</p>

<p>Debugging subrecipes is straightforward if you follow a few best practices:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-make-sure-each-recipe-runs-independently">1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/15/subrecipes-in-goose#1-make-sure-each-recipe-runs-independently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently" title="Direct link to 1. Make Sure Each Recipe Runs Independently">​</a></h3>
<p>This is crucial. Each subrecipe should work perfectly on its own. Test them individually before combining them. If a subrecipe fails when run alone, it will definitely fail as part of a larger workflow.</p>

<p>Always use <code>{{ recipe_dir }}</code> for file paths within your recipes. This makes your recipes portable and prevents path issues when someone runs them from a different directory.</p>

Parameter Validation is Your Friend" title="Direct link to 3. Parameter Validation is Your Friend">​</a></h3>
<p>Include clear parameter descriptions and mark required parameters. This prevents confusing errors when someone forgets to pass a needed value.</p>

<p>When running multiple subrecipes in parallel, watch your API rate limits and system resources. You might need to adjust the execution strategy for resource-intensive tasks.</p>

<p>Start simple. Pick a complex task you do regularly and break it into 2-3 smaller pieces. Create individual recipes for each piece, test them separately, then build a parent recipe to orchestrate them.</p>
<p>Some ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Creation Pipeline</strong>: Research, writing, editing, and formatting</li>
<li><strong>Development Workflow</strong>: Code generation, testing, documentation, deployment</li>
<li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization</li>
<li><strong>Project Setup</strong>: Structure creation, configuration, initial files, documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Subrecipes represent something bigger than just a goose feature. They're a glimpse into how we'll work with AI in the future -- not as monolithic systems trying to do everything, but as specialized agents working together toward common goals.</p>
<p>Each recipe becomes a reusable component that you can mix and match. Build a library of specialized recipes, then combine them in different ways for different projects. It's like having a toolkit of AI specialists ready to tackle any challenge.</p>
<p>Ready to start building your own subrecipe workflows? The kitchen is open, and all the ingredients are waiting for you.</p>

        <updated>2025-09-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I made existing MCP servers MCP-UI compatible with just a few lines of code]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcp-ui-0a7ec9ab9d9b8b0f84e1372e956cfbde.png" width="2240" height="1260" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://mcpui.dev/guide/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCP-UI</a> is in its infancy, and there's something addictive about being this early to the party. We're at this fascinating point where both the spec and client implementations are actively developing, and I find it thrilling to build alongside that evolution.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how far I could push it. So I grabbed two open source MCP servers, <a href="https://github.com/felores/cloudinary-mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudinary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem</a>, and gave them a UI. Instead of boring text, I now get rich, interactive interfaces right inside goose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-i-wanted-this">Why I Wanted This<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/08/turn-any-mcp-server-mcp-ui-compatible#why-i-wanted-this" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I Wanted This" title="Direct link to Why I Wanted This">​</a></h2>
<p>Raw JSON and text is fine, it gets the job done but let's be real I'd rather interact with something pretty. Give me a cool UI over back and forth prompts.</p>
<p>Take Cloudinary for example. By default, uploads return a block of text, basically a JSON dump of URLs, metadata, and public IDs. Useful, sure, but not exactly easy to glance at.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image and video previews</li>
<li>One‑click buttons to copy or view links</li>
<li>Transformation examples</li>
</ul>
<p>With MCP-UI, it’s not just text responses anymore. Now responses can be little apps you can actually click around in within your agent's chat interface.</p>

<p>Here’s the cool part, the steps are basically the same for any MCP server.</p>

<p>For my Cloudinary server update, I used <code>Direct HTML → iframe</code>. I wrote a function that returns an HTML string that includes upload previews and action buttons.</p>
<p>MCP-UI takes that HTML and renders it inside an iframe using <code>srcdoc</code>.<br>
<!-- -->It’s simple, totally self-contained, fast to iterate, and I get full control over how it looks.</p>
<p>💡 However, other modes exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>External URL</strong> – iframe a hosted page:<br>
<code>content: { type: "externalUrl", iframeUrl }</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote DOM</strong> – send a script that builds UI directly in the host’s DOM:<br>
<code>content: { type: "remoteDom", script, framework }</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But for my use case, <strong>Direct HTML was the perfect fit.</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-return-both"><strong>4. Return both</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/09/08/turn-any-mcp-server-mcp-ui-compatible#4-return-both" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-return-both" title="Direct link to 4-return-both">​</a></h3>
<p>In your tool handler, I recommend returning both the original response and the <code>createUIResource</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it. Regardless the server the main steps remain the same.</p>

<p>A clean UI is nice, but it gets way more interesting when those buttons actually do something. That’s where <strong>UI Actions</strong> come in; they turn static layouts into interactive tools that can talk back to your agent.</p>

<p>In my Cloudinary server, I added <strong>two</strong> UI actions right after the <code>ResizeObserver</code> in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block of <code>createUploadResultUI</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt Action</strong> → Fires off a prompt to goose asking it to caption the image like a meme.</li>

<p>That’s it. One extra resource, and suddenly goose renders a full UI.</p>

<p>To prove this wasn’t a one-off, I also made the Filesystem MCP server UI-compatible.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Text output (what goose shows by default)</p>

<p>I’ve now made two MCP servers UI-compatible, before MCP-UI is even fully rolled out. That's crazy to me.</p>
<p>And if you zoom out, you’ll see other companies pushing here too. goose and Postman already support rendering and a couple of UI actions. In goose right now, a button can fire off a new prompt or open an external link. It’s not the full vision yet, but it’s already enough to start building experiences that feel more like mini-apps than static responses.</p>
<p>That’s what excites me, we’re not waiting around. We’re experimenting in the open, and shaping what the future will feel like.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How an engineering team is trialling autonomous AI-powered technical debt cleanup]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-janitor-129889884d9265d001fe12cbfde03d57.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Over the years, Block's iOS engineers have felt the pain of technical debt accumulating. Feature flags are a specific example of this. Even when successfully rolled out, they tend to linger in the codebase, each one a small weight slowing down development.</p>
<p>In the early stages of 2025, with a renewed focus on developer acceleration, the Foundation iOS team decided to organize 'Feature Flag Removal Month' - an opportunity for teams in the large iOS monorepo to come together and delete <em>possibly hundreds of thousands of lines of dead code</em>.</p>
<p>With the serendipitous launch of Goose recipes around the same time, the team wondered could a dedicated recipe aid this effort? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmakbarlow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemma Barlow</a>, a newer iOS engineer on the team, wanted to find out.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phase-1-making-knowledge-ai-accessible">Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#phase-1-making-knowledge-ai-accessible" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible" title="Direct link to Phase 1: Making Knowledge AI-Accessible">​</a></h2>
<p>Gemma's first move was to utilize an existing system of <code>.mdc</code>, <code>.goosehints</code> and other symlinked context documents to capture how to safely remove feature flags from the repository.</p>
<p>She added documentation that allows AI agents to glean enough context to perform their removal work accurately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phase-2-validation-across-generations">Phase 2: Validation Across Generations<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#phase-2-validation-across-generations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 2: Validation Across Generations" title="Direct link to Phase 2: Validation Across Generations">​</a></h2>
<p>Given AI documentation is designed to work with a variety of tools in use at Block, further iteration and validation was needed. Several weeks of tests and trials later, it was confirmed the approach was accurate enough to be useful <em>and</em> it could handle the three different generations of feature flag implementations that had accumulated:</p>
<ul>
<li>super legacy flags the team used way back yonder</li>
<li>legacy flags that were newer but are now old</li>
<li>current implementation of feature flags</li>

<p>This documentation alone would help teams clean up faster. But now, AI could also understand and safely navigate the complexity of real world legacy systems in most scenarios, a win for developer velocity! 🎉</p>

<p>This was great progress. Gemma could have stopped here.</p>
<p>But instead, she utilized Goose recipes to create <strong>Goose Janitor</strong>.</p>
<p>Goose Janitor acts as new AI team member whose responsibility is to tidy up the code after we're done experimenting. It was heavily inspired by existing <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/recipes/detail/?id=clean-up-feature-flag">Goose recipes</a> and internal discussions and experimentation occurring elsewhere in Block. Here's how it is run:</p>

<p>The recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs completely autonomously (no human intervention needed)</li>
<li>Handles different flag implementations, ranging in complexity</li>
<li>Attempts refactoring for outdated code paths</li>
<li>Can automatically create draft pull requests, via the Github CLI</li>
<li>Integrates with <a href="https://github.com/block/xcode-index-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xcode Index MCP</a> for deep iOS project understanding</li>
<li>Plans, implements, builds and tests locally to improve the accuracy of the flag removal result</li>
</ul>

<p>Recipes like Goose Janitor represent a fundamental shift in how we think about AI in software development. They can be deployed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand complex legacy codebases</li>
<li>Make safe refactoring decisions</li>
<li>Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows</li>
<li>Provide developer velocity improvements</li>
<li>Scale across large codebases</li>
</ul>
<p>Teams at Block are confident that Goose Janitor will be of assistance in production scale cleanup work.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of work AI should handle: tedious, repetitive, but requiring deep codebase knowledge. By automating portions of their work, developers can focus on what they do best, which is building new features and solving novel problems while AI keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-ai-first-mindset">The AI-First Mindset<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/28/ai-teammate#the-ai-first-mindset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The AI-First Mindset" title="Direct link to The AI-First Mindset">​</a></h2>
<p>This story illustrates what an AI-first approach to legacy codebases looks like in practice.</p>
<p>Start by making tribal knowledge AI-accessible. Test and validate that AI can actually handle the complexity with enough accuracy to prove useful. Even if manual intervention is required for complex cases, a first pass performed by AI can be a useful boost to productivity. Build automation that scales across teams and focus human energy on high value creative work.</p>

<p>The success of Goose Janitor opens up fascinating possibilities. What other forms of technical debt could benefit from this approach? What other "AI team members" could we build to handle routine but knowledge intensive work?</p>
<p>As we move toward an AI-first future, stories like Gemma's show us the path. Not just using AI tools, but thinking systematically about how to make our codebases and processes AI-ready.</p>
<p>The future of software development is mixed teams where AI agents are autonomous contributors, handling the maintenance work that keeps our systems healthy while humans focus on building the future.</p>

<p>Data visualization just got a major upgrade in Goose. With the new MCP-UI auto visualiser feature, you no longer need to manually request charts, graphs, or visual representations of your data. Goose now automatically detects when data would benefit from visualization and renders interactive visual components directly in your conversation.</p>

<p>Once turned on, a smorgasboard of visualisation tools are made available as tools which will be automatically invoked if and when it makes sense to, for example, show things as a radar diagram, or a "sankey" diagram:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="sankey" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/sankey-10b4c1db30fdcaec0b1c538211385e47.png" width="1377" height="845" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can also explicitly ask for a visualisation, even specifying what style you want, and Goose will try to shape your data and then render it inline. This is powered by the <a href="https://mcpui.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCP-UI</a> emerging standard, which lets the MCP server formulate a visualisation (in this case using libraries like d3.js) and render it inline.</p>
<p>The autovisualiser analyzes data patterns and automatically suggests the most appropriate visualization type. My favourite is the treemap which is a great way to see relative sizes of things in a way that pie charts can mislead. It is also interactive in that you can drill down.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="tree map" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/treemap-fe432c41535964ba410c31915cb526fe.png" width="794" height="511" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Of course, if you want you can resort to the "last refuge of the unimaginative" and graph the weather:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="weather" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/weather-a3fbaf6e35e2793b986b8dcc4804620b.png" width="1006" height="658" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Note this is an early feature, and functionality may change and vary a lot (as with MCP-UI). This is an early example of what is emerging as generative UI, although in this case the templates are pre-generated and the data is dynamically matched to the session and then displayed (from local resources).</p>

<p>There are currently several families of things it can show:</p>
<ul>
<li>sankey diagrams</li>
<li>radar charts</li>
<li>chord diagrams</li>
<li>donut/pie charts</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New Goose users receive $10 in Tetrate Agent Router credits for instant access to multiple models including GPT-5 and Sonnet-4.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/tetrate-header-9e2afbf5d1ce961d5f25547a7439c65f.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You shouldn’t need a credit card to vibe code with Goose. While Goose is completely free to use, the reality is that most performant LLMs aren't. You want to experience Goose in action without breaking the bank or jumping through hoops. We've been thinking about how to make that first step easier for newcomers to Goose.</p>
<p>That's why we're thrilled about our newest provider integration: <a href="https://router.tetrate.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tetrate's Agent Router Service</a>. From August 27th through October 2nd, new Goose users can get $10 in credits to use Goose with any model on the Tetrate platform.</p>
<p>We've upgraded the onboarding flow. Tetrate Agent Router now appears as a <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation#set-llm-provider">recommended setup option</a> for new users. Selecting Tetrate takes you through OAuth account creation, then drops you back into Goose with your $10 credits ready to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="fresh install" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/welcome-759e755b4c027705f64202aad2ae75b6.png" width="955" height="1072" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This integration gives Goose users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instant access</strong> to models without manual setup</li>
<li><strong>$10 in credits</strong> to start building without a paywall</li>
<li><strong>A unified model layer</strong> powered by Tetrate</li>
<li><strong>Stable routing</strong> built on <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envoy</a>, an open source proxy for high-scale systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Tetrate's Agent Router Service provides unified access to a comprehensive collection of AI models including open source options to cutting-edge frontier models like GPT-5, Sonnet-4, and Grok-4.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-cloud-infrastructure-to-ai-model-routing">From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/27/get-started-for-free-with-tetrate#from-cloud-infrastructure-to-ai-model-routing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing" title="Direct link to From Cloud Infrastructure to AI Model Routing">​</a></h3>
<p>Tetrate brings years of expertise in routing and infrastructure to the AI space. As major contributors to open source projects like Istio and Envoy, they understand how to build reliable, scalable routing systems. Now they're applying this same expertise to LLM traffic management.</p>
<p>LLM requests are inherently stateless, making them ideal for intelligent routing across multiple providers and models. This allows you to optimize for cost, speed, availability, or quality, or even use multiple models to cross-check results. Terminology in this space is still settling. Goose refers to Tetrate as a “provider” for consistency, though under the hood it is a router service that connects to other providers. That layer abstracts away model selection, auth, and host config, keeping your setup clean.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-this-collaboration-matters">Why This Collaboration Matters<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/27/get-started-for-free-with-tetrate#why-this-collaboration-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why This Collaboration Matters" title="Direct link to Why This Collaboration Matters">​</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is simple: make Goose accessible to everyone, immediately. That means removing barriers to getting started. Tetrate's generous credit offering and seamless integration help us achieve exactly that.</p>
<p>It also reflects Tetrate's ongoing commitment to open source and making AI development more accessible to developers worldwide.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building community trust by having AI analyze AI recipes for safety]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Goose Recipe Safety" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-security-scanner-7fbe93f4a738fed2002e656fe66e715f.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Remember when people shared recipes by passing handwritten cards between neighbors? You trusted Grandma's apple pie recipe because you knew Grandma. But what happens when strangers start sharing recipes online? You need someone to taste-test them first.</p>
<p>That's exactly the challenge we face with Goose recipes. We're building a community cookbook where you can try Goose recipes from other users with confidence that they're safe. But we needed a way to make sure every recipe was safe to run.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-headless-solution">The Headless Solution<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#the-headless-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Headless Solution" title="Direct link to The Headless Solution">​</a></h2>
<p>I asked Goose: "Can you build a system to analyze your own recipes?"</p>
<p>The beautiful irony wasn't lost on me. I'm essentially asking our AI to become its own watchdog.</p>
<p>I gave it a lot more direction: I wanted the scanner to run from GitHub Actions, and I wanted the scanning to be done within a Docker container so it could inspect the recipe in an isolated environment.</p>
<p>After several high-level iterations on the concept and how it should work, Goose had built a complete security analysis system. It containerized itself, set up GitHub Actions workflows, and started scanning recipe submissions automatically.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="better-prompting-for-better-results">Better Prompting for Better Results<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#better-prompting-for-better-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Better Prompting for Better Results" title="Direct link to Better Prompting for Better Results">​</a></h3>
<p>My first build was pretty over-engineered. I simplified later by just giving Goose a prompt of "you're a security expert," but the results of that didn't work as well without guiding it on what kinds of things it should be looking for. I had to step up my prompting game to include <em>some</em> amount of specifics, but still giving Goose the flexibility to learn and grow and to download any tools it thought it needed to get the job done within the Docker container.</p>
<p>In the end I crafted a series of recipes that were safe, some that were maybe a little risky, and some that would be outright dangerous, and telling Goose some of the necessary things we want to watch out for.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works" title="Direct link to How It Works">​</a></h2>
<p>The process at a glance seems surprisingly simple but it's pretty complex -- picture the graceful goose swimming on the water but under the water the feet are thrashing around doing lots of work!</p>
<p>When someone submits a recipe via our GitHub issue template, it will start an automated scan. Goose spins up in an isolated Docker container, analyzes the recipe using its own security expertise plus some of our guidance, scores it for risk, and posts the results right back to the GitHub issue.</p>
<p>The whole process takes minutes instead of days, and the submitter gets immediate, transparent feedback about their recipe's safety. If something looks off, our team can review what's going on, and take appropriate action.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="goose-in-headless-mode">Goose in Headless Mode<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#goose-in-headless-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Goose in Headless Mode" title="Direct link to Goose in Headless Mode">​</a></h2>
<p>We've covered headless mode in <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/headless-goose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@goose-oss/search?query=headless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videos</a>, but here's a quick recap: headless mode allows Goose to run without a graphical user interface, making it faster and more efficient for automated tasks. It excels in server environments as long as we're being <em>really</em> clear about the instructions to follow, or a fallback if the instructions cannot be followed -- we don't want something half-finished or broken as a result if Goose gets stuck on what to do.</p>
<p>We launch the Docker container with something like this:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">docker run --rm \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -e AIMODEL_API_KEY="$AIMODEL_API_KEY" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -v "$PWD/$RECIPE_FILE:/input/recipe.yaml:ro" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    -v "$RECIPE_OUT:/output" \</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The first thing we're passing into Docker is the API key for whichever AI model we're using. i'm just using a placeholder of "AIMDOEL_API_KEY" but you would change this to OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY etc depending on the LLM you want Goose to use in your container.</p>
<p>Next, we're passing in the user's recipe that we're getting from GitHub, and then we have our "output" for logs and analysis.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-inside-the-container">Looking Inside the Container<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#looking-inside-the-container" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Inside the Container" title="Direct link to Looking Inside the Container">​</a></h3>
<p>Inside the container, we're installing Goose, and passing in a configuration file for which AI provider and model we want to use, plus a "base" recipe that tells Goose how to analyze the user's recipe. That recipe is also reinforcing a role of Goose being a security expert.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-learning-curve">The Learning Curve<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#the-learning-curve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Learning Curve" title="Direct link to The Learning Curve">​</a></h2>
<p>Just telling Goose "you're a security expert" wasn't enough. It took some back-and-forth to teach the difference between a recipe that downloads a helpful development tool, and something that downloads something sketchy to your home directory to look for sensitive data.</p>
<p>We had to fine-tune the balance between security and usability. Too strict, and legitimate recipes get flagged. Too lenient, and dangerous ones slip through. Getting that balance right required showing Goose lots of examples of both safe and risky patterns. We pass those into the Docker container as well, and our "base" recipe tells Goose to use those as inspiration.</p>
<p>Then we go into "headless" mode:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">goose run --recipe base_recipe.yaml --no-session --params recipe_path="user_recipe.yaml" &gt; /logs/results.txt</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This runs our "base" recipe, and skips storing a session since this is a one-off GitHub action anyway. Our base recipe looks for a parameter of where to find the user's recipe file, so we pass that parameter into our headless mode, and then we log the results. Those results are later picked up by our GitHub action to populate a comment on a GitHub issue or pull request.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-community-trust">Building Community Trust<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#building-community-trust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Community Trust" title="Direct link to Building Community Trust">​</a></h2>
<p>The real win isn't just the automation of all of this, it's the transparency. Every analysis is visible, consistent, and explained. Community members can see exactly why a recipe passed or failed, which builds trust in both the system and the recipes themselves.</p>
<p>Goose catches edge cases that humans might miss, like subtle obfuscation techniques or patterns that only become obvious when you're analyzing dozens of recipes. It's like having a security expert with perfect attention to detail who never gets tired.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-ai-to-review-ai-to-review-submissions">Using AI to review AI to review submissions<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/goose-became-its-own-watchdog#using-ai-to-review-ai-to-review-submissions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using AI to review AI to review submissions" title="Direct link to Using AI to review AI to review submissions">​</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes the best way to solve a potential AI problem is with more AI. Goose understands Goose behavior patterns better than any human reviewer could. It knows the legitimate ways to automate tasks and can spot when something deviates from those patterns. Using Goose to build this scanner wasn't just a time-saver for making the tool, it's a productivity win for our team from manually review every recipe ourselves.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit a recipe knowing it'll get a fair, thorough review. And when you see a recipe get a security approval, remember: it was approved by Goose itself.</p>

        <updated>2025-08-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover how MCP-UI is revolutionizing AI agent interactions by bringing rich, interactive web components directly into agent conversations, making AI more accessible and intuitive for everyone.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="mcp ui" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/mcpui-goose-44f248ede0eb5d2e0bddccf76e98b07e.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The days of endless text walls in AI agent conversations are numbered. What if instead of reading through paragraphs of product descriptions, you could browse a beautiful, interactive catalog? What if booking a flight seat could be as simple as clicking on your preferred spot on a visual seat map? This isn't science fiction. It's happening right now with MCP-UI.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GS-kmreZDgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wild Goose Case episode</a>, we dove deep into MCP-UI with its creators Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef from Monday.com, alongside Block's own Andrew Harvard, to explore how this groundbreaking technology is reshaping the future of agentic interfaces.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-with-text-only-interfaces">The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-problem-with-text-only-interfaces" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces" title="Direct link to The Problem with Text-Only Interfaces">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's be honest, we've all been there. You ask an AI agent to help you shop for shoes, and you get back a wall of text with product names, prices, and descriptions. Then you have to copy and paste URLs, open multiple tabs, and basically do all the work yourself. It defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant in the first place.</p>
<p>As Ido put it during our conversation: "I think everyone did something had a bunch of text and were like this is terrible why do I have to type all of that and kind of rage quit chat GPT."</p>
<p>The reality is that text-based interfaces work fine for early adopters and technical users, but they're not the future. They're certainly not going to work for everyone – including our moms, who are increasingly using AI assistants but shouldn't have to navigate complex text responses.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enter-mcp-ui-bridging-the-gap">Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#enter-mcp-ui-bridging-the-gap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap" title="Direct link to Enter MCP-UI: Bridging the Gap">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP-UI (Model Context Protocol User Interface) represents a fundamental shift in how we think about AI agent interactions. Instead of forcing users to consume everything through text, MCP-UI enables rich, interactive web components to be embedded directly into agent conversations.</p>
<p>The core philosophy is brilliant in its simplicity: <strong>Why throw away decades of web UI/UX expertise when we can enhance it with AI?</strong></p>
<p>As Liad explained: "We have more than a decade of human targeted interfaces on the web that are built and perfected for the human cognitive limitations and needs, and it doesn't make sense that agents will make us get rid of all of that."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-mcp-ui-works">How MCP-UI Works<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#how-mcp-ui-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How MCP-UI Works" title="Direct link to How MCP-UI Works">​</a></h2>
<p>At its heart, MCP-UI is both a protocol and an SDK that enables:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rich UI Components</strong>: Instead of text descriptions, you get interactive catalogs, seat maps, booking forms, and more</li>
<li><strong>Brand Preservation</strong>: Companies like Shopify keep their branding and user experience intact</li>
<li><strong>Seamless Integration</strong>: UI components communicate with agents through secure, sandboxed iframes</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: The same UI can work across different AI agents and platforms</li>
</ol>
<p>The magic happens through embedded resources in the MCP specification. When you interact with an MCP server that supports UI, instead of just returning text, it can return rich UI components that render directly in your agent interface.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-world-examples-in-action">Real-World Examples in Action<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#real-world-examples-in-action" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real-World Examples in Action" title="Direct link to Real-World Examples in Action">​</a></h2>
<p>During our demo, we saw some incredible examples of MCP-UI in action:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shopping-made-visual">Shopping Made Visual<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#shopping-made-visual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shopping Made Visual" title="Direct link to Shopping Made Visual">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of reading through product descriptions, users saw a beautiful Shopify catalog with images, prices, and interactive elements. Clicking on items added them to a cart, just like a regular e-commerce experience, but embedded seamlessly in the AI conversation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="travel-planning-reimagined">Travel Planning Reimagined<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#travel-planning-reimagined" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Travel Planning Reimagined" title="Direct link to Travel Planning Reimagined">​</a></h3>
<p>We watched as users could select airplane seats by clicking on a visual seat map, then have the agent automatically look up weather information for their destination cities, all without leaving the conversation or typing additional commands.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="restaurant-discovery">Restaurant Discovery<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#restaurant-discovery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Restaurant Discovery" title="Direct link to Restaurant Discovery">​</a></h3>
<p>The demo showed how users could browse local restaurants with rich cards showing photos, ratings, and menus, then place orders directly through interactive interfaces, all while maintaining the conversational flow with the AI agent.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-technical-foundation">The Technical Foundation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-technical-foundation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Technical Foundation" title="Direct link to The Technical Foundation">​</a></h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, MCP-UI prioritizes security and isolation. UI components are rendered in sandboxed iframes that can only communicate with the host through post messages. This ensures that third-party UI code can't access or manipulate the parent application.</p>
<p>The current implementation supports several content types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External URLs</strong>: Existing web apps embedded in iframes</li>
<li><strong>Raw HTML</strong>: Custom HTML components with CSS and JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Remote DOM</strong>: UI rendered in separate workers for enhanced security</li>
</ul>
<p>For developers, getting started is surprisingly simple. As Andrew demonstrated, you can begin with something as basic as:</p>

<p>MCP-UI's success depends on several key stakeholders:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agent Developers</strong> (like the Goose team): Need to implement MCP-UI support in their platforms</li>
<li><strong>MCP Server Developers</strong>: Build the UI components and integrate them with existing services</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong> (like Shopify, Square): Create rich interfaces for their platforms</li>
<li><strong>End Users</strong>: Benefit from more intuitive and visual AI interactions</li>
</ol>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that it creates a network effect. Once implemented, a Shopify MCP-UI component works across all compatible agents – from Goose to VS Code extensions to future mobile AI assistants.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-ahead-the-future-is-visual">Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#looking-ahead-the-future-is-visual" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual" title="Direct link to Looking Ahead: The Future is Visual">​</a></h2>
<p>The implications of MCP-UI extend far beyond just prettier interfaces. We're looking at:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="accessibility-revolution">Accessibility Revolution<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#accessibility-revolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Accessibility Revolution" title="Direct link to Accessibility Revolution">​</a></h3>
<p>As Ido noted: "What's more accessible than an agent that knows you and builds the UI for your preferences? You don't need to rely on every web app in the world to support or build that."</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="generative-ui">Generative UI<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#generative-ui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Generative UI" title="Direct link to Generative UI">​</a></h3>
<p>Future versions might move beyond static HTML to AI-generated interfaces tailored to individual users' needs, preferences, and accessibility requirements.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-modal-experiences">Multi-Modal Experiences<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#multi-modal-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-Modal Experiences" title="Direct link to Multi-Modal Experiences">​</a></h3>
<p>The protocol isn't limited to visual interfaces – it could extend to voice interactions, mobile native components, or even entirely new interaction paradigms we haven't imagined yet.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cross-platform-standardization">Cross-Platform Standardization<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#cross-platform-standardization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cross-Platform Standardization" title="Direct link to Cross-Platform Standardization">​</a></h3>
<p>Instead of every company building separate integrations for each AI platform, MCP-UI creates a standard that works everywhere.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-adoption-challenge">The Adoption Challenge<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-adoption-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Adoption Challenge" title="Direct link to The Adoption Challenge">​</a></h2>
<p>The technology is ready, but adoption is the next frontier. As the team emphasized, this is now more of an adoption problem than a technical one. The good news? Major players are already on board. Shopify has launched MCP support for all their stores, providing a massive real-world testing ground for commerce experiences. And of course, MCP-UI is supported in Goose.</p>
<p>For developers interested in contributing, the focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building real applications that solve actual user problems</li>
<li>Expanding the specification based on real-world needs</li>
<li>Creating better tooling and SDKs to lower the barrier to entry</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're excited about MCP-UI and want to start experimenting, here's where to begin:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check out the documentation</strong>: The MCP-UI team has created <a href="https://mcpui.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive docs and examples</a></li>
<li><strong>Join the community</strong>: There's an active <a href="https://discord.gg/4ww9QnJgCp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> for collaboration and discussion</li>
<li><strong>Start simple</strong>: Take an existing MCP server and add UI resources to it</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Goose</strong>: Try out <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/interactive-chat/mcp-ui">MCP-UI in Goose</a> to see it in action</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/25/mcp-ui-future-agentic-interfaces#the-bottom-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Bottom Line" title="Direct link to The Bottom Line">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP-UI represents a fundamental shift from text-heavy AI interactions to rich, visual, and intuitive experiences.</p>
<p>When you're browsing products, you want to see images and interact with catalogs. When you're booking travel, you want visual seat maps and itineraries. When you're managing your calendar, you want familiar interface patterns that just work.</p>
<p>MCP-UI makes all of this possible while preserving the conversational nature of AI agents. It's the bridge between the web as we know it and the agentic future we're building.</p>
<p>The future of interacting with AI relies on smarter interfaces. And with MCP-UI, that future is already here.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How a Junior developer's AI Agent confusion, led to creating an educational MCP extension that transforms Goose from an automation tool into a learning mentor.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Goose Mentor Mode Header" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/goose-mentor-mode-header-77058a250a163440d791e057ef3196ea.png" width="2816" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Kim is fresh out of the academy and has spent only 18 months learning development. When I asked her how she felt about Goose she had mixed reactions. While she found it cool that it could do so much for her, she wasn’t actually sure of <em>what</em> it was doing for her half the time, and also <em>why</em>. When she asked Goose to fix a broken build, or chase a bug, It would complete the task and claim ‘Success!’. Which is great, however she felt she wasn’t actually learning as much as when she was in the academy. Add on that sometimes she didn’t even know <em>what</em> to ask Goose to do sometimes.</p>
<p>That afternoon I started to see if I could get Goose to be more than just a ‘magic box’ for my Junior Devs. What if Goose could instead act as a mentor and also teach as well as speeding up development?</p>
<p>Working as an Engineering Manager in the enterprise space, I have around 16 developers in my team. Like a lot of the industry right now I’ve been seeing where AI can fit within our processes, and what efficiencies it can provide. In July of this year I picked up Goose and quickly saw the incredible potential it had for both myself and my team. Excited to see what was possible, I quickly granted access to all my developers, hooked them up with a few different models, and then let them play for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Within my team I have a vast range of developer experience. From Tech Leads, all the way down to fresh graduates. The Seniors and Tech Leads were marvelling at the speed with which they could now progress their work. My mid level Devs were also amazed at how fast they could debug broken builds. It wasn’t until one of my regular catch up meetings with one of my Junior Graduates did I hear something different.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches"><strong>The Problem: AI That Does Instead of Teaches</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches" title="Direct link to the-problem-ai-that-does-instead-of-teaches">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditional AI coding assistants operate on a simple premise: user asks, AI delivers. While this maximizes immediate productivity, it creates several long-term problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency Development</strong>: Developers become reliant on AI for problems they should understand</li>
<li><strong>Lost Learning Opportunities</strong>: Every request could be a chance to build knowledge, but instead becomes just task completion</li>
<li><strong>One-Size-Fits-All</strong>: No differentiation between a junior developer learning authentication and a senior developer implementing it under deadline pressure</li>
<li><strong>Context Blindness</strong>: AI treats "how do I implement JWT?" the same whether it's asked by someone with 6 months or 6 years of experience</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-vision-goose-mentor-mode"><strong>The Vision: Goose Mentor Mode</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#the-vision-goose-mentor-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-vision-goose-mentor-mode" title="Direct link to the-vision-goose-mentor-mode">​</a></h2>
<p>The mission behind Goose Mentor Mode is simple but transformative: <strong>Transform AI assistance from automation to education while maintaining the efficiency developers need</strong>.</p>
<p>The core philosophy centers on four principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discovery Over Delivery</strong>: Help users understand <em>why</em>, not just <em>how</em></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Learning</strong>: Adjust approach based on experience and context</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Complexity</strong>: Build understanding layer by layer</li>
<li><strong>Retention Focus</strong>: Emphasize learning that sticks</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-features-a-proof-of-concept"><strong>Current Features: A Proof of Concept</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#current-features-a-proof-of-concept" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to current-features-a-proof-of-concept" title="Direct link to current-features-a-proof-of-concept">​</a></h2>
<p>The core of how I envision the system functioning is by configuring some basic assistance levels:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-four-adaptive-assistance-levels"><strong>🎯 Four Adaptive Assistance Levels</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#-four-adaptive-assistance-levels" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -four-adaptive-assistance-levels" title="Direct link to -four-adaptive-assistance-levels">​</a></h3>
<p>Think of the Assistance Modes as a dial that can balance the speed of learning against the speed of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDED Mode</strong> - For deep learning through discovery</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses Socratic questioning to guide users to solutions</li>
<li>Perfect for new concepts and skill building</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: "What do you think JWT stands for? How might stateless authentication work?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXPLAINED Mode</strong> - Education with implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides detailed explanations alongside working code</li>
<li>Ideal for time-sensitive tasks with learning value</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: "Here's how JWT works... [detailed explanation] + working code"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ASSISTED Mode</strong> - Quick help with learning context</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct assistance with educational insights</li>
<li>Best for experienced developers needing quick help</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: "Use this JWT library. Key security considerations: [brief points]"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AUTOMATED Mode</strong> - Efficient task completion</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct solutions without educational overhead</li>
<li>For production pressure and repeated tasks</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: "Here's the complete JWT implementation."</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-learning-detection"><strong>🧠 Learning Detection</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#-learning-detection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -learning-detection" title="Direct link to -learning-detection">​</a></h3>
<p>Right now the system is in the PoC phase so I’m only using keyword checks for learning detection. I’m experimenting with semantic analysis to see if I can ‘intelligently’ do this, but that may prove overkill, or even bloat and slow down the system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>19 Technical Concepts</strong> across 7 categories (security, database, API, architecture, testing, performance, DevOps)</li>
<li><strong>6 Intent Categories</strong> for understanding request types (help requests, learning inquiries, debugging, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Context-Aware Analysis</strong> that distinguishes between "authentication error" vs "authentication best practices"</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-comprehensive-progress-tracking"><strong>📊 Comprehensive Progress Tracking</strong><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/transforming-ai-assistance-goose-mentor-mode#-comprehensive-progress-tracking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -comprehensive-progress-tracking" title="Direct link to -comprehensive-progress-tracking">​</a></h3>
<p>Ideally I can have long running progress tracking for each individual user that tracks over time. Right now this tracking is basic and only based on the current concept being ‘taught’.<br>
<!-- -->Some features of a fully implemented solution may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning velocity tracking across concepts</li>

<p>Although I did come up with the idea while at work, I quickly decided this would be a personal project outside of my organisation. This feels like something that should ideally be open source and open for wider adoption if it has merit. Right now the source code is available on github, as well as on PyPI for download.</p>

<p>Goose Mentor Mode represents more than just a new extension—it's a proof of concept for a fundamentally different relationship between developers and AI. Instead of creating dependency, it builds capability. Instead of providing fish, it teaches fishing.</p>
<p>The early results suggest this approach resonates with developers who want to grow, not just get things done. As AI becomes more prevalent in software development, tools like Goose Mentor Mode point toward a future where AI enhances human capability rather than replacing human thinking.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Context Windows" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/contextwindow-fa46f7a54cfb23a538d62f0e4502e19e.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Working with AI tools can feel like working with a flaky, chaotic, but overconfident coworker. You know, the kind who forgets tasks, lies unprovoked, starts new projects without telling you, then quits halfway through. It's enough to make you say: "Forget it. I'll do it myself." But before we write off AI entirely, it's worth understanding what's actually happening under the hood so we can avoid common pitfalls and make AI tools worth using.</p>
<p>The root of this behavior stems from how AI tools handle working memory. Similarly, as a human, you can only juggle so much information at once. For example, when I'm reading a really long research paper, I might forget key details from the introduction by the time I reach the conclusion, even though those early points were important for understanding the whole argument.</p>
<p>The technical term for AI assistants' working memory is <strong>context window</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-context-window">What is a context window?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#what-is-a-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a context window?" title="Direct link to What is a context window?">​</a></h2>
<p>A context window is the maximum amount of information an AI model can process in a single session. It's measured in "tokens."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-tokens">What are tokens?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#what-are-tokens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are tokens?" title="Direct link to What are tokens?">​</a></h2>
<p>Tokens are how AI models break down text for processing. They're roughly equivalent to words or word fragments, though different models vary in how they tokenize text based on their training data and design choices.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong><br>
<!-- -->"Hello" = 1 token<br>
<!-- -->"Understanding" = 2 tokens ("Under" + "standing")<br>
<!-- -->"AI" = 1 token<br>
<!-- -->"Tokenization" = 3 tokens</p>
<p>Test it yourself: paste any text into <a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI’s tokenizer tool</a> and explore how tokens are counted across models.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-goose-uses-tokens">How Goose uses tokens<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-goose-uses-tokens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Goose uses tokens" title="Direct link to How Goose uses tokens">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's talk about how this works in practice. When you use an AI agent like Goose, you start a session and choose a model like Claude Sonnet 3.7. This model has a context window of 128,000 tokens. This means every session (or conversation) can handle up to 128,000 tokens. If you message "hey" to Goose, you would have used one token. And when Goose responds back, you would have used several more tokens. Now you've used a small portion of your 128,000 tokens, and you have the remainder left.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note admonition_xJq3 alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>Context windows vary per LLM.</p></div></div>
<p>Once the conversation goes past 128,000 tokens or gets close to it, your agent may start to forget key details from earlier in the conversation, and it might prioritize the most recent information.</p>
<p>But your conversation isn't the only thing using your tokens. Here are other things within Goose that consume your token budget:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System prompt:</strong> A built-in prompt that instructs your agent on how to behave and defines its identity<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The system prompt defines Goose’s name, creator (Block), current date/time, task and extension handling, and response format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extensions and their tool definitions</strong> - Many extensions have more than one tool built in. For example, a Google Drive extension may include tools like read file, create file, and comment on file. In addition, each tool comes with instructions on how to use it and an explanation of what the tool does.</li>
<li><strong>Tool response</strong> - The response that the tool returns. For example, the tool could respond with "Here's the entire contents of your 500-line code file."</li>
<li>In addition to your conversation history, Goose keeps metadata about your conversation, such as timestamps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lot of data, and it can easily consume your context window. In addition to impacting performance, token usage affects costs. The more tokens you use, the more money you pay, and you may feel frustrated wasting your tokens on your agent misinterpreting your request.</p>
<p>Luckily, Goose has an intelligent design for helping you save your context window.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-goose-automatically-manages-your-context-window">How Goose automatically manages your context window<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-goose-automatically-manages-your-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Goose automatically manages your context window" title="Direct link to How Goose automatically manages your context window">​</a></h2>
<p>Goose has a method that auto-compacts (or summarizes) your conversation once it reaches a certain threshold. By default, when you reach 80% of your context window, Goose summarizes the conversation, preserving key parts while compressing the rest, reducing context window usage so you can stay in your session without starting a new one.</p>
<p>You actually have the ability to customize the threshold. If you think 80% is too little or too much for your workflow, you can set the environment variable <code>GOOSE_AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD</code> to your preferred threshold.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-manage-your-context-window">How to manage your context window<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/18/understanding-context-windows#how-to-manage-your-context-window" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to manage your context window" title="Direct link to How to manage your context window">​</a></h2>
<p>While Goose is adept at helping you manage your context window, you can proactively manage it, too. Here are some tips for efficiently managing your context window and your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>1. Manual summarization</strong></p>
<p>When your conversation gets too long, you can summarize the key points and start a new session. Copy important decisions, code snippets, or project requirements into the fresh session. This way, you keep the essential context without carrying over the full conversation history.</p>
<p><strong>2. <code>.goosehints</code></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/using-goosehints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.goosehints</a> files to avoid repeating the same instructions. Instead of typing out your project context, coding standards, and preferences in every conversation, define them once in a .goosehints file. This prevents wasting tokens on repetitive explanations and helps Goose understand your requirements more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Memory extension</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/memory-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memory extension</a> stores important information across sessions. Instead of re-explaining your project background, past decisions, or important context every time you start a new conversation, you can reference stored information. This keeps your prompts focused on the current task rather than repeating historical context.</p>
<p><strong>4. Recipes</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recipes</a> package complete task setups into reusable configurations, eliminating the need to provide lengthy instructions repeatedly. Instead of consuming tokens explaining complex workflows in every session, recipes contain all necessary instructions, extensions, and parameters upfront. This is particularly valuable for repetitive tasks where you'd otherwise spend significant tokens on setup and explanation. And if your recipe starts to feel overly lengthy, you can break the tasks up into <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/sub-recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-recipes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Subagents</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/experimental/subagents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subagents</a> handle specific tasks in their own isolated sessions. This prevents your main conversation from getting cluttered with implementation details and tool outputs. You delegate work to subagents and only see the final results, keeping your primary context window clean and focused.</p>
<p><strong>6. Short sessions</strong></p>
<p>Keep individual sessions focused on specific tasks. When you complete a task or reach a natural stopping point, start a new session. This prevents context window bloat from accumulated conversation history and ensures your tokens are spent on current, relevant work.</p>
<p><strong>7. Lead/worker model</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/lead-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lead/Worker model</a> splits work between two models. The lead model handles high-level planning and decision-making, while the worker model executes the detailed implementation. This optimizes costs by using expensive models for strategic thinking and cheaper models for routine execution tasks.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next time your AI agent seems to 'forget' something important or goes off track, check your context window usage first. The solution might be a better prompt or a cleaner context window. Often, the difference between flaky and focused is just a few tokens.</p>

<p>I taught a <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents">vibe coding workshop at UC Berkeley</a> and informed the students that we'd be spinning up 7 subagents. Someone quickly raised their hand and asked "what is a subagent?". At that moment, I realized we're just throwing out terms like <strong>agent</strong>, <strong>multi agent</strong>, and <strong>subagent</strong>, and not really taking the time to explain what these are. So, here goes... a 101 breaking down these various coordination patterns and when to use them.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip admonition_xJq3 alert alert--success"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>TL;DR</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>agent</strong> – one autonomous actor that takes your goal and runs with it end to end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>subagents</strong> - a setup where a main agent acts as orchestrator, delegating work to other agents it controls. The main agent owns the flow, order, and coordination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>multi agents</strong> – two or more main agents, each acting independently but able to collaborate, negotiate, or exchange results. No single agent is "the boss".</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>These terms sound fancy, but at the end of the day, these are just different ways to get stuff done with AI. Kind of like deciding if you want to work solo, pair program, or lead a squad.</p>
<p><strong>Let me illustrate this with a simple new feature: adding dark mode to our company’s web app.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-agent-solo-hero-mode">The Agent: Solo Hero Mode<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-agent-solo-hero-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Agent: Solo Hero Mode" title="Direct link to The Agent: Solo Hero Mode">​</a></h2>
<p>You give the task to one AI agent, such as <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/">Goose</a>. The agent is an autonomous actor, essentially your army of one.</p>
<p>You tell your agent, "Add dark mode to the app." It reads the repo, updates the CSS and themes, runs tests, and opens a PR. It handles the whole thing start to finish. No teammates, no handoffs.</p>
<p>If the agent messes up on one of these steps (e.g. say it forgets to update the toggle in the settings menu), it has to backtrack and fix it itself.</p>
<p>Think lone developer grinding through the ticket.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-subagent-setup-orchestrator-with-a-crew">The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-subagent-setup-orchestrator-with-a-crew" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew" title="Direct link to The Subagent Setup: Orchestrator With a Crew">​</a></h2>
<p>With <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/experimental/subagents">subagents</a>, you still have one "main" agent, but instead of doing everything, it plays tech lead and delegates pieces of the work to other specialized agents.</p>
<p>The main agent says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Designer agent, create the dark mode color palette."</em></li>
<li><em>"Frontend agent, apply it to all UI components."</em></li>
<li><em>"QA agent, run visual regression tests."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These subagents may work in parallel (e.g. while Designer is doing the palette, Frontend is updating styles) or sequentially (e.g. Frontend waits until Designer is done).</p>
<p>The main agent keeps everything on track, collects the results, and stitches them together.</p>
<p>Think of this as a tech lead breaking the feature into subtasks, assigning them, and merging the work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-multi-agent-scenario-two-main-brains-talking-it-out">The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#the-multi-agent-scenario-two-main-brains-talking-it-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out" title="Direct link to The Multi Agent Scenario: Two Main Brains Talking It Out">​</a></h2>
<p>With multi agents, there's no single orchestrator. You've got multiple main agents that talk to each other, each with its own goals or perspective.</p>
<p>For our dark mode feature, imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dev agent knows the codebase and can implement the UI changes.</li>
<li>The UX research agent knows how users interact with themes and what accessibility needs to be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>They work together. The UX agent explains the best practices, edge cases, and user pain points, while the dev agent implements and checks back for feedback. They might even run on different systems, like your dev agent calling an external design agent hosted somewhere else.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that multi agent setups don't have to be working on the exact same task. Sometimes they’re just operating in the same environment and will collaborate when their work overlaps.</p>
<p>Think of this as two peers hashing it out over Slack until they've got something solid.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-which">When to Use Which<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/agent-coordination-patterns#when-to-use-which" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to Use Which" title="Direct link to When to Use Which">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>agent</strong>: small, self-contained tasks you trust one AI to own</li>
<li><strong>subagents</strong>: complex tasks that benefit from dividing and conquering with oversight</li>
<li><strong>multi agents</strong>: requires multiple brains or perspectives that can negotiate and collaborate</li>
</ul>
<p>These setups are just different ways to organize work, whether it's human work or AI work. The trick is picking the structure that gets you the best balance of speed and accuracy.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How a simple prompt transformed a blank website into a personal portfolio]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog banner" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/blog_banner-656bd5e1014edfbcd313a9f799f9e9a5.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A website to me is a corner of the internet where I can be who I am, share my work, and ultimately a place I can do whatever I want with. For it to be anything but my personality personified, especially as an ex-nerdy blog designer (in my middle school and high school days), felt so sad! Until suddenly, what started out as a harmless "404 Day" challenge quickly turned into making that website in basically no time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="going-back-to-my-roots">Going Back to My Roots<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#going-back-to-my-roots" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Going Back to My Roots" title="Direct link to Going Back to My Roots">​</a></h2>
<p>When I say I was a nerdy blog creator for other people, I mean I was living in the deep-end of HTML and CSS. It was a hobby where I got to create super-customized websites for other nerds like myself on the internet. So it was really bugging me to have a website today that was basically :poopemoji: personified. No character, no style of my own, just a minimal generic layout I was paying a monthly subscription for just to avoid complete embarassment. It's been a decade at least since then, and I was NOT in the mood to sit here and relearn pieces to create a website structure from scratch. I had all the pieces in my drafts, just needed structure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-404-challenge-that-started-it-all">The 404 Challenge That Started It All<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#the-404-challenge-that-started-it-all" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The 404 Challenge That Started It All" title="Direct link to The 404 Challenge That Started It All">​</a></h2>
<p>Then came this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/block-opensource_happy-404-day-we-used-goose-to-generate-activity-7313972103613939713-GF1T/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple and easy prompt on 404 day</a>. The post was about creating your own 404 page using goose, where goose will give you a custom page based on your profile. The original prompt went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a 404 page that tells a creative story about GitHub user @taniashiba using their public GitHub data — commit history, contribution graph, repos, or anything else you can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took this prompt, and modified it a bit. My personal GitHub profile and contributions are great, but I also wanted to make sure goose referenced my LinkedIn, Instagram, and all other social channels to get a good grasp of me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also reference Tania's Bluesky/Instagram/TikTok/Twitter accounts (username @taniashiba) along with her LinkedIn for additional info on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="404 page" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/404page-a6e9f936e90c573008a5523d4779575e.png" width="1280" height="1196" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Quickly brought to life is a 404 page that is witty and actually pretty reflective of who I am and what I like in its styling. It even inserted a shrimp joke I had made in a past social post. I didn't even tell goose about any color combos I love, and somehow it made something that spoke to me. This lit a bright spark of inspiration. So, I asked goose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you remember that you made this? I'd love for you to make a website in this exact styling for taniachakraborty.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation">Implementation<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation">​</a></h2>
<p>goose was helping me resolve what felt like an age-old problem, and made it so simple to do. I gave goose my website, told goose it was hosted on Neocities, and it went to work. After creating general pages with the styling it made for the 404 page, implementation was easy:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> the files goose made onto Neocities</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong> the site and ask goose to edit or create any pages I needed</li>
<li><strong>Write content</strong> to fill the different pages of my website (my favorite part)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then boom, my website was done. No wrestling ancient memories from my mind to relearn CSS, no debugging issues caused by a responsive hover effect I thought was cool at 2 AM, no troubles at all. Goose handled everything. It started with a simple structure, used the styling it came up with from the 404 day challenge, and made changes as I asked for them in conversation. My website went from being embarrasingly empty to being wonderfully designed and easy to edit in <em>minutes</em>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="always-use-git">Always Use Git<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/14/how-goose-rebuilt-my-website#always-use-git" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Always Use Git" title="Direct link to Always Use Git">​</a></h2>
<p>It honestly felt like playing a video game, because I could see changes happen live in my local preview, and with git I could save progress as we went. Goose even suggested I add my blog posts from my dev.to page, and created a simple template for me. And if anything wasn't showing up as intended? We just troubleshooted together by me sending screenshots of what I was seeing, and goose simply fixing it.</p>

<p>Something that would've taken me anywhere from a week to a month to build was done instantly. Instead of worrying about learning or relearning a skill in order to build something you need right now, you can learn as you go along with goose. This entire experience reminded me why I fell in love with styling websites for others in the first place, you really create something out of nothing!</p>
<p>So if you're sitting there with a naked website that needs help, or if you've been putting off a project because the technical aspects feel like an overwhelming nightmare, maybe it's time you start a conversation with a useful tool like goose. And who knows? Maybe you will end up with your own digital aquarium of a website with shrimp jokes about debugging lurking in your website footer. 🦐</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="pulsemcp" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/pulsemcp-65abe93bd65402c122b395ae6bdadf95.png" width="1600" height="840" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><em>"The best AI agent workflows go beyond demos. They deliver real productivity."</em></p>
<p>The DevRel team at Block is a huge fan of <a href="https://pulsemcp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PulseMCP</a>. Their weekly newsletter has been an amazing way for us to discover trending MCP servers and stay in the loop with any changes within the ecosystem. When the PulseMCP creators, Mike and Tadas, shared their goals of using Goose to help <a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/building-agents-with-goose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate the boring parts of their newsletter workflow</a>, we were excited to see what they'd build.</p>
<p>Their implementation showcased exactly why we built Goose's feature set the way we did, and they documented the entire journey to help others learn from their experience.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-challenge">The Challenge<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/13/pulse-mcp-automates-recipe#the-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenge" title="Direct link to The Challenge">​</a></h2>
<p>Every week, the PulseMCP team faced the same time-consuming workflow: sourcing relevant news from multiple platforms, organizing and removing duplicates, drafting compelling narratives, polishing for quality and accuracy, publishing across multiple channels, and managing email distribution. This repetitive workflow seemed perfect for AI automation, but was complex enough that most attempts fail.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution-why-sequential-beats-monolithic">The Solution: Why Sequential Beats Monolithic<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/13/pulse-mcp-automates-recipe#the-solution-why-sequential-beats-monolithic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Solution: Why Sequential Beats Monolithic" title="Direct link to The Solution: Why Sequential Beats Monolithic">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of building one massive "do-everything" agent (which inevitably fails on complex tasks), PulseMCP broke their workflow into six distinct phases. Each phase gets handled by focused <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/session-recipes">recipes</a>, <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/sub-recipes">sub-recipes</a> and <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/experimental/subagents">subagents</a> with clear inputs, outputs, and a single job.</p>
<p>This approach has three main benefits: debugging becomes easier when agents have single responsibilities, results become more predictable with clear handoffs between stages, and humans stay in control of the editorial process while automating the tedious work.</p>

<p>What's remarkable isn't just that PulseMCP automated their newsletter but how they kept human creativity while eliminating boring work. Humans still make editorial decisions, craft narratives, and maintain creative control, while agents handle repetitive tasks that drain human energy.</p>
<p>The result is a workflow that's both more efficient and higher quality. Agents never tire of checking links or formatting content, freeing humans to focus on strategic thinking and creative storytelling.</p>

<p>The PulseMCP team envisions agents that "build these recipes on your behalf." Imagine describing your workflow in natural language and having AI automatically generate the agent architecture and integration points.</p>
<p>We're already seeing hints of this capability. As Tadas demonstrated this by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hey Goose: I have these AI agent log files that are hard to read. Can you build me a simple web server with a pretty UI where I can parse through these as a human?"*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points toward a future where AI handles the mechanics while humans focus on strategy, creativity, and judgment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-blueprint-is-available">The Blueprint is Available<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/13/pulse-mcp-automates-recipe#the-blueprint-is-available" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Blueprint is Available" title="Direct link to The Blueprint is Available">​</a></h2>
<p>The PulseMCP team documented everything in a comprehensive 95-page handbook that serves as both inspiration and implementation guide. Their work proves that successful AI agent deployment isn't about replacing humans or building complex AI systems but about thoughtful workflow design, clear boundaries, and practical patterns.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/building-agents-with-goose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the complete PulseMCP handbook: "A Human, A Goose, and Some Agents"</a></strong></p>
<p>Their detailed case study includes complete agent architectures, actual YAML recipe files, production deployment lessons, and a practical cheatsheet for building your own agents.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automate MCP tool metadata validation using composable Goose recipes to catch regressions, optimize token usage, and ensure AI agents can reliably discover and use your tools.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Automated MCP Testing" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/automated_mcp_testing-296dac2cd2b1b327e58854f4bfb0c89a.jpg" width="1472" height="832" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, most development focuses on tool functionality, ensuring tools execute and return expected results. But just as critical is the quality of tool metadata: descriptions, tooltips, and input schemas. These elements form the "interface language" between tools and AI agents like Goose.</p>
<p>Yet metadata often goes untested. This can break tool discovery and silently degrade agent behavior. In this post, we’ll show how to automate metadata validation using <strong>composable Goose recipes</strong>, turning manual QA into modular, repeatable workflows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate tool discoverability and parameter accuracy</li>
<li>Detect regressions early</li>
<li>Safely reduce token usage</li>
</ul>
<p>All while maintaining the quality that AI agents depend on.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-the-challenges-of-manual-metadata-testing">1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#1-the-challenges-of-manual-metadata-testing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing" title="Direct link to 1. The Challenges of Manual Metadata Testing">​</a></h2>
<p>Manually validating MCP metadata—by running queries and inspecting agent behavior—breaks down quickly as your toolset grows. It’s inefficient, inconsistent, and prone to silent regressions.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-limitations">Key Limitations:<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#key-limitations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Limitations:" title="Direct link to Key Limitations:">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow &amp; Unscalable</strong>: Requires spinning up the agent, entering queries, and reviewing outputs by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Results</strong>: Varies across environments and models, making issues hard to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Silent Failures</strong>: Broken tooltips lead to incorrect tool selection, missing or misinterpreted parameters, and tool conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>No Regression Safety Net</strong>: Changes in one tool’s metadata can affect others with no system in place to detect it.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Coverage</strong>: Manual QA can’t account for the diversity of real-world user queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep pace with growing MCP complexity, <strong>automated metadata validation becomes a practical necessity</strong>.</p>

<p>The foundation of this framework is <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goose’s recipe engine</a>. Recipes define reusable, declarative workflows for AI-assisted tasks. Each one encapsulates a step—like generating predictions or comparing results—and can be composed into larger pipelines.</p>
<p>We start with a core recipe that maps natural language queries to tool calls. It reads queries, analyzes the toolset, and produces structured JSON mappings. This recipe becomes the building block for workflows like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluating predictions against a gold set</li>
<li>Integrating regression checks into CI</li>
<li>Running token optimization loops</li>
</ul>
<p>By chaining and wrapping recipes, we avoid duplication and unlock scalable, repeatable QA for MCP tool discoverability.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-the-core-engine-goose-recipe-for-tool-prediction">3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#3-the-core-engine-goose-recipe-for-tool-prediction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction" title="Direct link to 3. The Core Engine: Goose Recipe for Tool Prediction">​</a></h2>
<p>At the heart of the system is a Goose recipe that systematically transforms natural language queries into structured tool predictions. This recipe follows a clear three-step process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>read queries → analyze tools → generate predictions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-how-it-works-step-by-step">🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#-how-it-works-step-by-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step" title="Direct link to 🔄 How It Works: Step-by-Step">​</a></h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Read Queries</strong>
The recipe starts by reading a plain text file containing natural language queries, one per line:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">List contributors to the block/mcp repository</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">List the top 10 contributors to block/goose</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Show me the closed branches in block/mcp</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Show me all branches in the block/goose repository</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Ask Goose to Make Predictions</strong>
Using the developer extension, Goose analyzes the MCP server source code and documentation to understand available tools, their parameters, and usage patterns. It then maps each query to the most appropriate tool call.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Write Predictions to JSON</strong>
The output is a structured JSON file with each query mapped to its expected tool and parameters.</p>

<p>Having established the core Goose recipe component in Section 3, we can now leverage its modularity to build more complex workflows. The beauty of this architecture is that the core prediction recipe becomes a reusable building block—we can reference it from other recipes, chain it with comparison logic, and compose end-to-end testing pipelines. This demonstrates the power of treating recipes as separate modules that can be orchestrated together for sophisticated automation workflows.</p>
<p>Once predictions are generated via the core recipe, the next step is to detect regressions by comparing them against a curated "gold standard" dataset. This automated evaluation follows a clear three-step process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>generate predictions → compare with gold set → interpret results</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Step 1: Generate Predictions Using the Core Recipe</strong>
First, we run the core recipe from Section 3 to generate fresh predictions based on the current tool metadata:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">goose run --recipe generate_predictions_recipe.yaml --params output_file=new_evaluation.json</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This produces a JSON file with current tool predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Compare Predictions with Gold Standard</strong>
Next, we use a Python comparison script to identify differences between the new predictions and our verified gold standard:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">python compare_results.py new_evaluation.json mcp_github_query_tool_truth.json</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The script performs a structured diff, flagging mismatches in tool names, parameters, or values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Ask Goose to Interpret Results</strong>

<p>Building on the modular recipe architecture established in previous sections, we can create even more sophisticated workflows that combine multiple automation steps. One powerful example is an iterative token reduction pipeline that safely compresses MCP tool descriptions while ensuring functionality remains intact.</p>
<p>This workflow demonstrates the true power of composable Goose recipes—we can orchestrate the core prediction recipe from Section 3 and the evaluation workflow from Section 4 into a continuous optimization loop that reduces token usage without breaking tool discoverability.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-the-optimization-loop-step-by-step">🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/12/mcp-testing#-the-optimization-loop-step-by-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step" title="Direct link to 🔄 The Optimization Loop: Step-by-Step">​</a></h4>
<p>The token reduction workflow follows an iterative process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>reduce tokens → run evaluation → fix issues → run evaluation → repeat</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compress Tool Descriptions</strong>
Using natural language processing, Goose identifies verbose tooltips, redundant documentation, and unnecessary examples, then compresses them while preserving essential information.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Run Evaluation Pipeline</strong>
The system automatically triggers the evaluation workflow from Section 4 to test whether the compressed descriptions still allow correct tool discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Fix Issues</strong>
If evaluation tests fail, Goose analyzes the specific mismatches and iteratively fixes the compressed tooltips to restore functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Repeat Until Success</strong>
The loop continues until all evaluation tests pass, ensuring no regressions in tool discoverability.</p>

<p>Automated MCP metadata validation doesn’t have to be brittle or one-off. By using a <strong>modular Goose recipe architecture</strong>, we’ve shown how a single core prediction recipe can power multiple high-value workflows—from <strong>catching regressions early</strong> to <strong>reducing tokens safely</strong> without sacrificing discoverability.</p>
<p>This composable approach offers three big wins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong> – The same core logic supports different workflows without rewriting code.</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong> – Automated validation ensures changes never silently break tool usage.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> – The architecture works across any MCP server or toolset, regardless of size.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these building blocks in place, teams can confidently expand their automation toolkit—knowing every new optimization or enhancement will be backed by the same rigorous, repeatable validation process.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog cover" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/header-image-bed3ed59a52ea231c1da0707b9b6d287.png" width="1200" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Ever wondered what happens when you let two AI models work together like a tag team? That’s exactly what we tested in our latest livestream—putting Goose’s Lead/Worker model to work on a real project. Spoiler: it’s actually pretty great.</p>
<p>The Lead/Worker model is one of those features that sounds simple on paper but delivers some amazing benefits in practice. Think of it like having a project manager and a developer working in perfect harmony - one does the strategic thinking, the other gets their hands dirty with the actual implementation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-this-leadworker-thing-all-about">What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#whats-this-leadworker-thing-all-about" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?" title="Direct link to What's This Lead/Worker Thing All About?">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of asking one LLM to do everything, Lead/Worker lets you split the load. Your lead model takes care of the thinking, decision-making, and big-picture planning, while your worker model focuses on execution—writing code, running commands, and making the plan happen. The magic is in the balance: you can put a more powerful (and sometimes more expensive) model in the lead and let a faster, more cost-effective one handle the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Popular model pairings people are loving:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-4 + Claude Sonnet – Balanced intelligence and efficiency.</li>
<li>Claude Opus + GPT-3.5 – Creative planning with quick execution.</li>
<li>GPT-4o + Local models – Privacy-focused builds where data stays in-house.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>💰 Cost Optimization
Use cheaper models for execution while keeping the premium models for strategic planning. Your wallet will thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>⚡ Speed Boost<br>
<!-- -->Get solid plans from capable models, then let optimized execution models fly through the implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🔄 Mix and Match Providers
This is where it gets really cool - you can use Claude for reasoning and OpenAI for execution, or any combination that works for your workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏃‍♂️ Handle Long Dev Sessions
Perfect for those marathon coding sessions where you need sustained performance without breaking the bank.</p>
</li>

<p>Getting started with the Lead/Worker model is surprisingly straightforward. In the Goose desktop app, you just need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enable the feature</strong> - Look for the enable button in your settings</li>
<li><strong>Choose your lead model</strong> - Pick something powerful for planning (like GPT-4)</li>
<li><strong>Select your worker model</strong> - Go with something efficient for execution (like Claude Sonnet)</li>
<li><strong>Configure the behavior</strong> - Set how many turns the worker gets before consulting the lead</li>
</ol>
<p>The default settings work great for most people, but you can customize things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of turns</strong>: How many attempts the worker model gets before pulling in the lead</li>
<li><strong>Failure handling</strong>: What happens when things don't go as planned</li>
<li><strong>Fallback behavior</strong>: How the system recovers from issues</li>
</ul>

<p>During our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbBDBv9Chvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>, we tackled a real project: adding install buttons to the MCP servers documentation page. What made this interesting wasn't just the end result, but watching how the two models collaborated.</p>
<p>The lead model would analyze the requirements, understand the existing codebase structure, and create a plan. Then the worker model would jump in and start implementing, making the actual code changes and handling the technical details.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-project-documentation-enhancement">The Project: Documentation Enhancement<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/llm-tag-team-lead-worker-model#the-project-documentation-enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Project: Documentation Enhancement" title="Direct link to The Project: Documentation Enhancement">​</a></h3>
<p>We wanted to add install buttons to our MCP server cards, similar to what we already had on our extensions page. We needed to figure out how to add this functionality without breaking existing workflows.</p>
<p>Here's what the Lead/Worker model helped us accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyzed the existing documentation structure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Identified the best approach</strong> (creating a custom page vs. modifying existing ones)</li>
<li><strong>Implemented the solution</strong> with proper routing and styling</li>
<li><strong>Handled edge cases</strong> like maintaining tutorial links while adding install functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that really stood out was how natural the interaction felt. You're not constantly switching contexts or managing different tools. You just describe what you want, and the system figures out the best way to divide the work.</p>
<p>The lead model acts as your strategic partner, while the worker model becomes your implementation buddy. It's like pair programming, but with AI models that never get tired or need coffee breaks.</p>

<p>Let the lead model do its planning thing. Sometimes the best results come from giving high-level direction and letting the system figure out the details.</p>

<p>Always work in a branch when experimenting. The models are smart, but having that safety net means you can be more adventurous with your requests.</p>

<p>While the desktop UI doesn't show the model switching as clearly as the CLI does, you can still follow along by expanding the tool outputs to see what's happening under the hood.</p>

<p>By the end of our session, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Successfully added install buttons to our MCP server documentation</li>
<li>✅ Maintained all existing functionality (tutorial links still worked)</li>
<li>✅ Improved the user experience with better visual hierarchy</li>
<li>✅ Organized content into logical sections (community vs. built-in servers)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part? The models made smart decisions we hadn't even thought of, like automatically categorizing the servers and improving the overall page layout.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/lead-worker">Lead/Worker model</a> is available now in Goose. Whether you're working on documentation, building features, or tackling complex refactoring, having two specialized models working together can be a game changer.</p>

<p>Goose recently released support for <a href="https://mcpui.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCP-UI</a> which allows MCP servers to suggest and contribute user interface elements back to the agent.</p>

It works as is but may change as the proposal advances.</p></div></div>
<p>MCP-UI sits on top of the protocol, but instead of text/markdown being the result, servers can return content that the client can render richly (including interactive GUI content).</p>
<p>Many everyday activities that agents undertake could benefit from a graphical representation. Sometimes this is done by the agent rendering a GUI on its own (I know I do that a lot), but this allows it to be more intrinsic to extensions for cases where interaction is best done graphically with a human. It also naturally (hence the <a href="https://shopify.engineering/mcp-ui-breaking-the-text-wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify connection</a>) works well with commerce applications where you want to see the product!</p>
<p>It is worth taking a minute to watch this MCP server for an airline seat selector demo to get a sense of the capability:</p>

<p>Essentially, MCP servers are suggesting GUI elements for the client (agent) to render as it sees fit.</p>

<p>At the heart of MCP-UI is an interface for a <code>UIResource</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>mimeType</code> is where the action happens. It can be HTML content, for example (in the simplest case).</p>
<p>Another key tech at play here is <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/remote-dom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote DOM</a>, which is an open source project from Shopify. It lets you take DOM elements from a sandboxed environment and render them in another one, which is quite useful for agents. This also opens up the possibility that the agent side can render widgets as it needs (i.e., with locally matching styles or design language).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="possible-futures">Possible futures<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/11/mcp-ui-post-browser-world#possible-futures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Possible futures" title="Direct link to Possible futures">​</a></h2>
<p>It's still early days for MCP-UI, so the details may change, but that is part of what makes experimenting with it exciting right now.</p>
<p>MCP-UI will continue to evolve, and may pick up more declarative ways for MCP-UI servers to specify they need forms or widgets of certain types, but without specifying the exact rendering. How nice would it be to be able to specify these components and let the agent render it beautifully, be that in a desktop or mobile client, or even a text UI in a command line!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how to build a full-stack AI app in under an hour using Goose's subagent orchestration, from planning to testing.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="blog cover" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/header-image-b685ea475ff7b8ae3563317b347fddb0.png" width="1200" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>What if I told you that you could build a complete, working web application in under an hour using nothing but AI agents? Not just a simple "Hello World" app, but a full-stack application with a backend API, responsive frontend, unit tests, and documentation?</p>
<p>That's exactly what we accomplished during the Vibe Coding workshop at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_w5m3h9jY-w?t=5310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkeley's Agentic AI Summit</a>, where I demonstrated how to use Goose's subagent orchestration to spin up an entire development team of AI agents. Each agent took on a specific role - from product planning to QA testing - and worked together to build "AI BriefMe", a web app that generates executive style briefings on any topic.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-multi-agent-development">The Power of Multi-Agent Development<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents#the-power-of-multi-agent-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of Multi-Agent Development" title="Direct link to The Power of Multi-Agent Development">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditional AI coding assistants are great at helping you write individual functions or debug specific issues. But what if you need to build something from scratch? What if you want to simulate an entire software development lifecycle?</p>
<p>That's where Goose's subagent feature shines. Instead of doing everything yourself, you can orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents, each with their own expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧠 <strong>Planner</strong> - Defines the product vision and MVP scope</li>
<li>📋 <strong>Project Manager</strong> - Breaks down tasks and coordinates execution</li>
<li>🏗️ <strong>Architect</strong> - Sets up project structure and tech stack</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> - Builds the interface</li>
<li>🧩 <strong>Backend Developer</strong> - Builds the API logic</li>
<li>🧪 <strong>QA Engineer</strong> - Writes tests and identifies production blockers</li>
<li>📝 <strong>Tech Writer</strong> - Documents setup, usage, and API details</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-workshop-experience">The Workshop Experience<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents#the-workshop-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Workshop Experience" title="Direct link to The Workshop Experience">​</a></h2>
<p>During the live workshop, participants followed along as we built AI BriefMe step by step. The beauty of this approach is that you're not just watching someone code, you're learning how to prompt and orchestrate AI agents effectively.</p>
<p>Here's how the workflow unfolded:</p>

<p>First, we spun up a Planner agent to define what we were building. Instead of diving straight into code, the Planner created a clear product definition:</p>

<p>The Architect agent established the technical foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stack</strong>: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, Express.js backend</li>
<li><strong>API Design</strong>: Simple POST endpoint accepting <code>{"topic": "string"}</code></li>
<li><strong>File Structure</strong>: Organized project with clear separation of concerns</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: Express, CORS, and child_process for calling Headless Goose</li>
</ul>
<p>The Architect also defined the API contract, which made it possible for the the next step where the frontend and backend developer agents can work in parallel.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-4-parallel-development">Step 4: Parallel Development<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents#step-4-parallel-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 4: Parallel Development" title="Direct link to Step 4: Parallel Development">​</a></h3>
<p>This is where things got really interesting. We spun up two developer agents simultaneously:</p>
<p>The <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> created:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean, responsive interface with modern CSS</li>
<li>Form handling with loading states</li>
<li>Error handling and user feedback</li>
<li>Copy-to-clipboard functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Backend Developer</strong> implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express server with proper error handling</li>
<li><code>/api/briefing</code> endpoint that uses Headless Goose for AI generation</li>
<li>Response parsing and JSON formatting</li>
<li>Timeout handling and CORS configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the coolest aspects of this project was how the backend used <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/headless-goose">Headless Goose</a> by essentially calling Goose programmatically to generate the AI briefings:</p>

<p>This creates a fascinating recursive scenario: we're using Goose to build an app that uses Goose to generate content. It's AI agents all the way down!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-5-testing-and-docs">Step 5: Testing and Docs<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents#step-5-testing-and-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 5: Testing and Docs" title="Direct link to Step 5: Testing and Docs">​</a></h3>
<p>Finally, we ran QA and Tech Writer agents in parallel:</p>
<p>The <strong>QA Engineer</strong> delivered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive unit test suite using Jest</li>
<li>Mocked external dependencies for reliable testing</li>
<li>Detailed analysis of production-readiness blockers</li>
<li>Security and performance recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Tech Writer</strong> produced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete README with setup instructions</li>
<li>API documentation with examples</li>
<li>Troubleshooting guide</li>
<li>Usage examples and best practices</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-results-in-real-time">Real Results in Real Time<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/10/vibe-coding-with-goose-building-apps-with-ai-agents#real-results-in-real-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real Results in Real Time" title="Direct link to Real Results in Real Time">​</a></h2>
<p>By the end of the hour, participants had a fully functional web application. Here's what the final product delivered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean UI</strong>: Professional-looking interface that works on desktop and mobile</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Content</strong>: Generates structured briefings with titles, dates, and key takeaways</li>
<li><strong>Code Examples</strong>: For technical topics, includes relevant code snippets</li>
<li><strong>Production Insights</strong>: QA analysis revealed specific areas needing attention before deployment</li>
<li><strong>Complete Documentation</strong>: Everything needed to run, modify, and extend the app</li>
</ul>
<p>But here's the important part: this wasn't production-ready code. The QA agent was very clear about that, flagging security, performance, and scalability issues.</p>

<p>This workshop perfectly illustrates the current state of AI-assisted development. Goose and its subagents can absolutely accelerate prototyping and help you build working applications quickly. But the human developer still owns the critical judgment calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture decisions</strong>: Is this the right approach for the problem?</li>
<li><strong>Security considerations</strong>: What are the risks we need to mitigate?</li>
<li><strong>Production readiness</strong>: What needs to be hardened before real users touch this?</li>
<li><strong>Business logic</strong>: Does this actually solve the user's problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>What we demonstrated in this workshop hints at a fascinating future for software development where we might find ourselves orchestrating AI agent teams. The skills that matter become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt engineering</strong>: How do you communicate requirements clearly to AI agents?</li>
<li><strong>System design</strong>: How do you break complex problems into agent-sized tasks?</li>
<li><strong>Quality assurance</strong>: How do you validate and test AI-generated code?</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: How do you combine outputs from multiple agents into cohesive solutions?</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="MCP Jupyter Server" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/data-goose-7fc60ab0a13a9e9b6c22172d6ac166ab.png" width="1200" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Machine learning and data science workflows are inherently iterative. You load data, explore patterns, build models, and refine your approach based on results. But traditional AI assistants lose context between interactions, forcing you to reload data and re-establish context repeatedly—making data-heavy development slow and expensive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/block/mcp-jupyter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MCP Jupyter Server</strong></a> solves this by enabling AI agents like Goose to work directly with your Jupyter notebooks, maintaining persistent memory and state across interactions while letting the AI interact with your data through code execution rather than raw data transfer.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-memory-and-context-problem">The Memory and Context Problem<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/04/mcp-jupyter-server#the-memory-and-context-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Memory and Context Problem" title="Direct link to The Memory and Context Problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditional AI coding assistants face a fundamental limitation: they lose context between interactions. This in part stems from their design to accomplish well-described individual tasks like refactoring a piece of code, compiling and running its tests, and commiting the result version control. In contrast, data science workflows are often open-ended and require extensive exploration and interactivity. This creates several challenges for using AI with data-heavy ML workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant data reloading</strong>: Each interaction requires re-loading or describing your dataset</li>
<li><strong>Expensive iteration</strong>: Large datasets are slow and costly to process repeatedly</li>
<li><strong>Context size</strong>: The raw data may be too large to be fit in context</li>
<li><strong>Not designed for interactive work</strong>: It is harder to have the assistant do some steps and then transfer control back to the human or vice versa</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these challenges, we created the MCP Jupyter Server.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-better-approach-persistent-state">A Better Approach: Persistent State<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/08/04/mcp-jupyter-server#a-better-approach-persistent-state" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Better Approach: Persistent State" title="Direct link to A Better Approach: Persistent State">​</a></h2>
<p>The MCP Jupyter Server takes a different approach. Instead of losing context between interactions, it maintains persistent memory and lets the AI interact with your data through Jupyter code cell execution. This creates a powerful paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistent memory</strong>: Variables and state are maintained across all interactions</li>
<li><strong>Efficient iterations</strong>: No need to reload data or re-establish context</li>
<li><strong>Code-based data interaction</strong>: AI explores data through execution, not given the raw data in context</li>
<li><strong>True pair programming</strong>: Seamless collaboration within the same notebook context</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of describing your dataset, let the AI explore it directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "Help me understand this customer dataset"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Let me explore your data structure first"</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[AI executes: df.info(), df.describe(), df.head()]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I can see you have 50,000 customers with 12 features. The data includes demographics (age, income), behavioral metrics (purchase_frequency, avg_order_value), and some missing values in the 'phone_number' column. Would you like me to create visualizations for the key relationships, like age vs income or purchase patterns?"</p>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "Yes, show me the age and income distributions, and any correlations"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Perfect! I'll create histograms for age and income, plus a correlation heatmap"</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[AI generates and displays visualizations]</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AI can see your actual column names, data types, and distributions—leading to much more relevant suggestions.</p>

<p>The AI becomes a true collaborator in your modeling process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "This model isn't performing well"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Let me check the current metrics and feature importance"</p>

<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I see the accuracy is 72% and the most important features are 'price' and 'location'. The model seems to be overfitting - would you like me to try regularization or reduce the feature set?"</p>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "Try regularization first"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I'll add L2 regularization and test different alpha values"</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[AI implements and tests changes iteratively]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Great! With alpha=0.1, accuracy improved to 78% and the validation curve looks much better. Should I tune it further or try ensemble methods?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When errors occur, the assistant has full context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "I'm getting a KeyError in cell 5"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Let me check what columns are available in your dataframe"</p>

<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I see the issue - you're trying to access 'customer_id' but the actual column name is 'CustomerID' with capital letters. Also, I notice you have 'purchase_date' as a string - should I convert that to datetime while I fix the KeyError?"</p>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "Yes, fix both issues"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Done! I've updated the column reference and converted purchase_date to datetime. The cell should run properly now."</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where you are working on a new dataset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> <em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[Executes: df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')]</span></em></p>

<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I'll analyze your sales data structure"</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[AI executes: df.info(), df.describe(include='all')]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "I found a few issues: 'CustomerID' is stored as text but should be numeric, and there are 847 missing values in 'SalesAmount'. Would you like me to convert 'CustomerID' to numeric and fill the missing 'SalesAmount' values with the median?"</p>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "Yes, please do that and show me the updated info"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Done! CustomerID is now numeric and SalesAmount gaps are filled. Your dataset is clean and ready for modeling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[Later in the session, after you've trained a model...]</span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#2563eb;font-weight:bold">User:</span> "How is my model performing?"</p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Let me generate the key metrics for your trained model"</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#6b7280;font-style:italic">[AI accesses the existing model variable and generates evaluation metrics]</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#059669;font-weight:bold">AI:</span> "Your Random Forest achieved 0.84 precision and 0.81 recall. The confusion matrix shows some false positives in the high-value sales category. Would you like me to adjust the decision threshold or try feature engineering?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fluid back-and-forth, where the assistant understands and builds upon the existing notebook state, allows for seamless collaboration without the need for constant context re-establishment or data reloading.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How we used Open Router to provide frictionless LLM access for Goose workshops]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Scaling AI Workshops" src="https://block.github.io/goose/assets/images/scaling-ai-workshops-open-router-2af052d2b72f502ba14b06c4d784c0cc.png" width="1206" height="633" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When my team launched <a href="https://block.github.io/goose/">Goose</a> in early January 2025, we knew we had something special. We built a free, open source AI agent that leverages the Model Context Protocol. It was inventive in its approach, offering developers a local solution with the flexibility to bring their LLM of choice.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-llm-cost-problem">The LLM Cost Problem<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/07/29/openrouter-unlocks-workshops#the-llm-cost-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The LLM Cost Problem" title="Direct link to The LLM Cost Problem">​</a></h2>
<p>After using the product internally for a few months, my teammates were eager to share Goose with the developer community through workshops and hackathons. We wanted to provide hands-on experiences where people could actually build with Goose, because that's how developers fall in love with a product.</p>
<p>But we hit a thorny challenge: while Goose is free, high-performing LLMs are not.</p>
<p>Free, local open source models exist, but the experience is variable and often requires high-end hardware. Many local models struggle with tool calling or have small context windows. It would be unfair to ask people to pay out of pocket just to try the tool.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="existing-solutions-we-considered">Existing Solutions We Considered<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/07/29/openrouter-unlocks-workshops#existing-solutions-we-considered" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Existing Solutions We Considered" title="Direct link to Existing Solutions We Considered">​</a></h2>
<p>Our team initially looked into covering LLM usage costs. After talking to other organizations, here's what we found. People either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually distributed API keys</li>
<li>Used one shared API key</li>
<li>Relied on a partnership with a provider for credits</li>
</ul>
<p>For our small but scrappy team, these options felt insecure, inflexible, and unscalable. We were concerned that people would steal and misuse shared API keys, or that credits might not get distributed evenly. Manually sharing API keys would be tedious and time-consuming, taking away from the depth of the meetup.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discovering-openrouter">Discovering OpenRouter<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/07/29/openrouter-unlocks-workshops#discovering-openrouter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discovering OpenRouter" title="Direct link to Discovering OpenRouter">​</a></h2>
<p>When I came back from parental leave, I was ready to jump back in and tackle this problem head-on. I started by teaming up with Alex Hancock, an MCP steering committee member and Goose OSS engineer, on planning our first-ever meetup in Boston. My boss, Angie Jones, suggested the meetup would be the perfect moment to get people's hands on Goose.</p>
<p>This gave me the motivation I needed to find a quick solution. I figured I could create a web app that would generate API keys for attendees. They could grab their key, which would already have a preset amount of credits.</p>
<p>The only problem was that popular providers like OpenAI and Anthropic didn't allow me to set specific credit amounts per API key.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://openrouter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenRouter</a>: "a unified API platform that provides access to a wide range of large language models with intelligent routing and automatic fallbacks." You can use whatever model you want with the same API key. But the feature I really needed was its provisionary API key system, which allowed me to generate one master key and programmatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create individual API keys on demand</li>
<li>Set specific credit limits per key ($5 per participant)</li>
<li>Manage and disable keys as needed</li>
<li>Support any model available through their platform</li>
<li>Avoid the chaos of shared or static keys</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-the-web-app">Building the Web App<a href="https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/07/29/openrouter-unlocks-workshops#building-the-web-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building the Web App" title="Direct link to Building the Web App">​</a></h2>
<p>I built a simple web app around OpenRouter's API. Attendees could visit a link, click a button, and instantly get their own temporary API key. They could plug that into Goose and start building without having to set up an account on OpenRouter.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/keys \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">     -H "Authorization: Bearer &lt;PROVISIONARY API KEY&gt;" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">     -d '{</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  "name": "string"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}'</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>And it worked. People <em>actually</em> used Goose and loved the entire experience, from the meetup to the talks to Goose itself.</p>

<p>This system isn't perfect. Right now, it's still a separate experience outside the Goose interface, and it doesn't scale well for events with different credit amounts or more complex needs.</p>
<p>We're working on it. Goose engineer, Mic Neale recently opened a <a href="https://github.com/block/goose/pull/3507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request</a> to automate Goose's first-time setup. It simplifies the onboarding flow so new users can log into OpenRouter through their browser, securely authenticate, and get a pre-configured Goose setup without touching config files or copying API keys. It's a huge leap in user experience and lays the groundwork for future improvements.</p>

<p>As more developers experiment with local agents and bring-your-own-model setups, we need infrastructure that matches that flexibility without compromising control. The combination of flexible API providers and programmatic key management might just be the missing piece in your event strategy.</p>
<p>Want us to run a Goose workshop or hackathon? We’ll bring the API credits. You bring the builders.</p>
