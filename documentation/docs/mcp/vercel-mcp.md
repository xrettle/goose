This tutorial covers how to add the [Vercel MCP Server](https://vercel.com/docs/mcp/vercel-mcp) as a Goose extension to manage your Vercel projects and deployment status directly from Goose.

:::info
Note that you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to run installation commands, which use `npx`.

## Configuration

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    <GooseDesktopInstaller
      extensionId="Vercel"
      extensionName="Vercel"
      description="Access Vercel deployments and manage projects"
      type="http"
      url="https://mcp.vercel.com"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    <CLIExtensionInstructions
      name="Vercel"
      type="http"
      url="https://mcp.vercel.com"
      timeout={300}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example Usage

### Goose Prompt
```
Get a list of my Vercel projects via the Vercel MCP server, and build me a table showing when I last deployed the project and other details I should know about their status.
```

The first time you use the Vercel MCP server, you will be prompted to authenticate with Vercel via OAuth.

### Goose Output
```
I'll help you get your Vercel projects and create a table with deployment details. Let me first get your teams to identify which team to use for listing projects.

> List Teams

> teamId: team_p3hPvXImXmdkbZ36FoqhoyYo


Now let me get the deployment information for each project to see the last deployment dates and status:

> projectId, teamId

> projectId, teamId

> projectId, teamId

Now let me get more details about each project to provide a comprehensive table:

> projectId, teamId

> projectId, teamId

> projectId, teamId

Based on the data from your Vercel projects, here's a comprehensive table showing your project status and deployment information:

Recommendations
- Monitor the building project: Check on project1 as it's currently building
- Portfolio maintenance: Your project2 is well-maintained and actively used
- Domain setup: Consider adding a custom domain to your other projects if needed
- Node versions: You have mixed Node versions (20.x and 22.x) - consider standardizing
- All projects are connected to GitHub repositories and have automatic deployments configured.
