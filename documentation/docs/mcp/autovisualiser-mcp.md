The Auto Visualiser extension enables Goose to automatically generate interactive data visualizations directly in your conversation. This built-in extension leverages MCP-UI to create charts, graphs, maps, and other visual representations of your data without requiring manual requests.

This guide will cover enabling and using the Auto Visualiser MCP Server.

## Configuration


<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
  <GooseBuiltinInstaller
    extensionName="Auto Visualiser"
    description="Automatically generate interactive data visualizations"
  />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">

  1. Run the `configure` command:
  ```sh
  goose configure
  ```

  2. Choose to `Toggle Extensions`
  ```sh
  ┌   goose-configure 
  │
  ◇  What would you like you configure?
  │  Toggle Extensions 
  │
  ◆  Enable extensions: (use "space" to toggle and "enter" to submit)
  // highlight-start    
  │  ● autovisualiser
  // highlight-end  
  └  Extension settings updated successfully
  ```
  </TabItem>

## Visualization Types

The Auto Visualiser is a powerful extension that integrates with Goose's MCP-UI system to automatically detect when data would benefit from visualization and render interactive visual components. It analyzes data patterns in your conversations and suggests the most appropriate visualization type.

| Chart Type | Description | Detected When Prompt Implies |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Sankey Diagrams** | Flow data visualization showing relationships and quantities | Flow or process data <br/>(workflows, funnels, process datasets) |
| **Radar Charts** | Multi-dimensional data comparison (spider charts) | Multi-dimensional comparisons <br/>(performance metrics, feature comparisons) |
| **Donut/Pie Charts** | Categorical data visualization with support for multiple charts | Categorical proportions <br/>(percentage breakdowns, category distributions) |
| **Treemap Visualizations** | Hierarchical data with proportional area representation | Hierarchical data <br/>(nested categories, organizational structures) |
| **Chord Diagrams** | Relationship and flow visualization between entities | Relationship matrices <br/>(network connections, cross-references) |
| **Interactive Maps** | Geographic data visualization with location markers using Leaflet | Geographic information <br/>(location data, coordinates, addresses) |
| **Line/Bar/Scatter Charts** | Traditional chart types for data analysis | Time series data <br/>(historical data, trends over time) |

### Example Visualizations

 ]}
 names={[
    "Sankey",

### Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Goose intelligently chooses the best visualization type for your data
- **Interactive Components**: All visualizations are interactive with hover effects, zooming, and drilling capabilities
- **MCP-UI Integration**: Leverages the emerging MCP-UI standard for seamless rendering
- **Multiple Chart Support**: Can render multiple visualizations in a single response
- **Customizable Styling**: Supports custom colors, labels, and formatting options
- **Export Capability**: Visualizations can be saved as HTML files for sharing


## Example Usage

In this example, I'll have Goose analyze some sales data and automatically visualize it using the Auto Visualiser extension.


### Goose Prompt
```
I have quarterly sales data for different product categories. Can you help me understand:
1. The hierarchical breakdown of revenue across our nested product categories
2. How our performance metrics compare across all four quarters  
3. The customer flow through our sales funnel process

Here's the data:
- Electronics: Q1: $150k, Q2: $180k, Q3: $220k, Q4: $195k
- Clothing: Q1: $120k, Q2: $140k, Q3: $160k, Q4: $175k  
- Home & Garden: Q1: $80k, Q2: $95k, Q3: $110k, Q4: $125k
```

### Goose Output

I'll help you analyze your quarterly sales data with three different visualizations to address each of your questions. Let me create these visualizations for you.

First, let's visualize the hierarchical breakdown of your revenue across product categories:

![](/img/autovisualiser-radar.png)

![](/img/autovisualiser-sankey.png)


I've created three comprehensive visualizations to help you understand your quarterly sales data from different perspectives:

#### 1. Hierarchical Revenue Breakdown (Treemap)
The **treemap visualization** shows your revenue hierarchy with proportional areas representing the relative size of each category and quarter. Key insights:
- **Electronics** is your largest revenue generator ($745k total)
- **Clothing** follows as second largest ($595k total) 
- **Home & Garden** is smallest but growing ($410k total)
- You can see how each quarter contributes within each category

#### 2. Performance Metrics Comparison (Radar Chart)
The **radar chart** displays how all three product categories performed across the four quarters, making it easy to compare:
- **Electronics** shows strong Q3 performance ($220k) with slight Q4 decline
- **Clothing** demonstrates consistent growth throughout the year
- **Home & Garden** shows steady upward trajectory across all quarters
- All categories show their strongest performance in Q3-Q4

#### 3. Sales Funnel Flow (Sankey Diagram)
The **Sankey diagram** represents customer flow through your sales process, with flow thickness proportional to revenue:
- Shows how market opportunities flow into prospects for each category
- Demonstrates the conversion from prospects to actual sales
- **Electronics** has the thickest flow (highest revenue conversion)
- **Home & Garden** has the thinnest but represents growth opportunity

#### Key Business Insights:
- **Total Revenue**: $1.75M across all categories
- **Growth Pattern**: All categories show positive growth trends
- **Category Performance**: Electronics (42.6%), Clothing (34%), Home & Garden (23.4%)
- **Seasonal Trends**: Q3 appears to be your strongest quarter overall

Would you like me to create additional visualizations or dive deeper into any specific aspect of your sales data?

## Troubleshooting

- **Visualization not appearing**: Ensure the Auto Visualiser extension is enabled and your data follows the expected format.

- **Data format errors**: Check that your data structure matches the required schema for the visualization type. The extension provides detailed error messages to guide you.

- **Performance with large datasets**: For very large datasets, consider aggregating or sampling your data before visualization.
