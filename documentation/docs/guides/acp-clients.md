Client applications that support the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) can connect natively to goose. This integration allows you to seamlessly interact with goose directly from the client.

:::warning Experimental Feature
ACP is an emerging specification that enables clients to communicate with AI agents like goose. This feature has limited adoption and may evolve as the protocol develops.
:::

## How It Works
After you configure goose as an agent in the ACP client, you gain access to goose's core agent functionality, including its extensions and tools. goose also automatically loads any [configured MCP servers](#using-mcp-servers-from-acp-clients) from your ACP client alongside its own extensions, making their tools available without additional configuration.

The client manages the goose lifecycle automatically, including:

- **Initialization**: The client runs the `goose acp` command to initialize the connection
- **Communication**: The client communicates with goose over stdio using JSON-RPC
- **Multiple Sessions**: The client manages multiple concurrent conversations, each with isolated state
- **Model and Mode Switching**: The client can switch models and modes mid-session without restarting
- **File Operations**: The client handles file reads and writes, so goose sees changes not yet saved to disk and edits show as native diffs
- **Terminal**: The client runs commands in its own terminal, so output appears alongside the conversation

:::info Session Persistence
ACP sessions are saved to goose's session history where you can access and manage them using goose. Access to session history in ACP clients might vary.
:::

:::tip Reference Implementation
The [goose for VS Code](/docs/experimental/vs-code-extension) extension uses ACP to communicate with goose. See the [vscode-goose](https://github.com/aaif-goose/vscode-goose) repository for implementation details.
:::

## Setup in ACP Clients
Any editor or IDE that supports ACP can connect to goose as an agent server. Check the [official ACP clients list](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/clients) for available clients with links to their documentation.

### Example: Zed Editor Setup

ACP was originally developed by [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Zed offers two ways to add goose, and you can use either one.

#### Option 1: Install from the ACP Registry (recommended)

goose is published in the [ACP Registry](https://agentclientprotocol.com/registry), and Zed 1.5.0 and later has built-in registry support, so it can download and run goose for you, with no manual configuration and no pre-installed CLI required.

1. Open Zed
2. Open Agent Settings
3. Click `Add Agent`, then choose `Install from Registry`
4. Select `goose`

A registry-installed goose runs the same `goose acp` server and reads your existing goose configuration, so your providers, models, and extensions carry over. Zed keeps the installed version up to date for you.

#### Option 2: Configure goose as a Custom Agent

Use a custom agent if you want to run your own goose binary (for example, a local development build) or pass environment overrides.

##### Prerequisites

Ensure you have both Zed and goose CLI installed:

- **Zed**: Download from [zed.dev](https://zed.dev/)
- **goose CLI**: Follow the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation)

  - Verify goose is installed: `goose --version`

  - Temporarily run `goose acp` to test that ACP support is working:

    ```bash
    goose acp
    ```

    Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the test.

##### Add goose to Your Zed Settings

1. Open Zed
2. Open Agent Settings, click `Add Agent`, then choose `Add Custom Agent`. Zed scaffolds an `agent_servers` entry and opens your settings file
3. Edit the entry so it runs goose:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "goose": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "goose",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  },
}
```

You should now be able to interact with goose directly in Zed. Your ACP sessions use the same extensions that are enabled in your goose configuration, and your tools (Developer, Computer Controller, etc.) work the same way as in regular goose sessions.

#### Start Using goose in Zed

After adding goose with either option above:

1. **Open the Agent Panel**: Click the sparkles agent icon in Zed's status bar
2. **Create New Thread**: Click the `+` button to show thread options
3. **Select goose**: Choose `New goose` to start a new conversation with goose
4. **Start Chatting**: Interact with goose directly from the agent panel

#### Advanced Configuration

##### Overriding Provider and Model

By default, goose will use the provider and model defined in your [configuration file](/docs/guides/config-files). You can override this for specific ACP configurations using the `GOOSE_PROVIDER` and `GOOSE_MODEL` environment variables.

The following Zed settings example configures two goose agent instances. This is useful for:
- Comparing model performance on the same task
- Using cost-effective models for simple tasks and powerful models for complex ones

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "goose": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "goose",
      "args": ["acp"]
    },
    "goose (GPT-4o)": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "goose",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOSE_PROVIDER": "openai",
        "GOOSE_MODEL": "gpt-4o"
      }
    }
  },
}
```

## Using MCP Servers from ACP Clients

MCP servers configured in the ACP client's `context_servers` are automatically available to goose. This allows you to use those MCP servers when using both native client features and the goose agent integration.

**Example (Zed):**

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/dir"
      ]
    }
  },
  "agent_servers": {
    "goose": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "goose",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  },
}
```

To find out what tools are available, just ask goose while it's running in the client.

:::info
All MCP servers in `context_servers` are automatically available to goose, provided that they use stdio (command-based) or HTTP transports. goose doesn't support servers that use the deprecated SSE transport.

If a server in `context_servers` has the same name as a goose extension, goose uses its own [configuration](/docs/guides/config-files).
:::

## TUI Client (Deprecated)

:::warning Deprecated
The experimental terminal UI (TUI) client, formerly published to npm as `@aaif/goose`, is no longer maintained and has been removed. Use the [CLI](/docs/getting-started/installation) or the desktop app instead.
:::

## Server Authentication

Set the `GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY` environment variable to authenticate the ACP endpoint. `goose serve` refuses to start without this secret unless you explicitly pass `--dangerously-unauthenticated`:

```bash
GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY='a-long-random-secret' goose serve
```

Clients authenticate by sending the token in the `X-Secret-Key` header, or as a `?token=` query parameter for WebSocket connections (the browser WebSocket API can't set custom headers). Requests without a matching token receive `401 Unauthorized`, including WebSocket handshakes.

ACP WebSocket Origin validation allows loopback web origins by default. For `goose serve`, ACP CORS follows the same policy. If you pass any `--allowed-origin` values, that explicit list replaces the default loopback origins, so include every origin the client needs:

```bash
GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY='a-long-random-secret' goose serve \
  --allowed-origin 'http://localhost:5173' \
  --allowed-origin 'app://localhost' \
  --allowed-origin 'https://app.example'
```

For local development only, `goose serve --dangerously-unauthenticated` starts without a secret and logs a warning. Do not use this mode with shell-capable builtins enabled unless the server is isolated from untrusted browser traffic.

### Single Prompt Mode

Send a single prompt and exit (useful for scripting):

```bash
npm start -- --text "What files are in this directory?"
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `↑` / `↓` | Scroll current response |
| `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` | Navigate conversation history |
| `Tab` | Expand/collapse tool call details |
| `Ctrl+C` or `Esc` | Exit (or cancel permission dialog) |

### Permission Dialog

When goose requests permission to use a tool, a dialog appears with these options:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Allow once |
| `a` | Always allow |
| `n` | Reject once |
| `N` | Always reject |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate options |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
