description: Run multiple sub-recipes instances concurrently with real-time progress tracking
---

Goose recipes can execute multiple [sub-recipe](/docs/guides/recipes/sub-recipes) instances concurrently using isolated worker processes. This feature enables efficient batch operations, parallel processing of different tasks, and faster completion of complex workflows.

:::warning Experimental Feature
Running sub-recipes in parallel is an experimental feature in active development. Behavior and configuration may change in future releases.
:::

Here are some common use cases:

- **Monorepo build failures**: When 3 services fail in a monorepo build, use a "diagnose failure" sub-recipe with each build URL to diagnose all failures in parallel
- **Document summarization**: Process a CSV file with document links by running a "summarize document" sub-recipe for each link simultaneously  
- **Code analysis across repositories**: Run security, quality, and performance analysis on multiple codebases simultaneously

## How It Works

Parallel sub-recipe execution uses an isolated worker system that automatically manages concurrent task execution. Goose creates individual tasks for each sub-recipe instance and distributes them across up to 10 concurrent workers.

| Scenario | Default Behavior | Override Options |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Different sub-recipes** | Sequential | Add "in parallel" to prompt |
| **Same sub-recipe** with different parameters | Parallel | • Set `sequential_when_repeated: true`<br />• Add "sequentially" to prompt |

### Different Sub-Recipes

When running different sub-recipes, Goose determines the execution mode based on:
1. **Explicit user request** in the prompt ("in parallel", "sequentially") 
2. **Sequential execution by default**: Different sub-recipes run one after another unless explicitly requested to run in parallel

In your prompt, you can simply mention "in parallel" in your prompt when calling different sub-recipes:

```yaml
prompt: |
  run the following sub-recipes in parallel:
    - use weather sub-recipe to get the weather for Sydney
    - use things-to-do sub-recipe to find activities in Sydney
```

### Same Sub-Recipe

When running the same sub-recipe with different parameters, Goose determines the execution mode based on:
1. **[Recipe-level configuration](#choosing-between-sequential-and-parallel-execution)** (`sequential_when_repeated` flag) - when set to true, this forces sequential execution
2. **User request** in the prompt ("sequentially" to override default parallel behavior)
3. **Parallel execution by default**: Multiple instances of the same sub-recipe run concurrently

If your prompt implies multiple executions of the same sub-recipe, Goose will automatically create parallel instances:

```yaml
prompt: |
  get the weather for three biggest cities in Australia
```

In this example, Goose recognizes that "three biggest cities" requires running the weather sub-recipe multiple times for different cities, so it executes them in parallel.

If you wanted to run them sequentially, you can just tell Goose:

```yaml
prompt: |
  get the weather for three biggest cities in Australia one at a time
```

### Real-Time Progress Monitoring

When running multiple tasks in parallel from the CLI, you can track progress through a real-time dashboard that automatically appears during execution. The dashboard provides:
- **Live progress tracking**: Monitor task completion in real-time with statistics for completed, running, failed, and pending counts
- **Task details**: View unique task IDs, parameter sets, execution timing, output previews, and error information as tasks progress from Pending → Running → Completed/Failed 

## Examples

### Running Different Sub-Recipes in Parallel

This example runs the `weather` and `things-to-do` sub-recipes in parallel:

```yaml
# plan_trip.yaml
version: 1.0.0
title: Plan Your Trip
description: Get weather forecast and find things to do for your destination
instructions: You are a travel planning assistant that helps users prepare for their trips.
prompt: |
  run the following sub-recipes in parallel to plan my trip:
    - use weather sub-recipe to get the weather forecast for Sydney
    - use things-to-do sub-recipe to find activities and attractions in Sydney
sub_recipes:
- name: weather
  path: "./sub-recipes/weather.yaml"
  values:
    city: Sydney
- name: things-to-do
  path: "./sub-recipes/things-to-do.yaml"
  values:
    city: Sydney
    duration: "3 days"
extensions:
- type: builtin
  name: developer
  timeout: 300
  bundled: true
```

### Running the Same Sub-Recipe in Parallel (with Different Parameters)

This example runs three instances of the `weather` sub-recipe in parallel for different cities:

```yaml
# multi_city_weather.yaml
version: 1.0.0
title: Multi-City Weather Comparison
description: Compare weather across multiple cities for trip planning
instructions: You are a travel weather specialist helping users compare conditions across cities.
prompt: |
  get the weather forecast for the three biggest cities in Australia 
  to help me decide where to visit
sub_recipes:
- name: weather
  path: "./sub-recipes/weather.yaml"
extensions:
- type: builtin
  name: developer
  timeout: 300
  bundled: true
```

**Sub-Recipes:**

<details>
  <summary>weather</summary>
    ```yaml
    # sub-recipes/weather.yaml
    version: 1.0.0
    title: Find weather
    description: Get weather data for a city
    instructions: You are a weather expert. You will be given a city and you will need to return the weather data for that city.
    prompt: |
      Get the weather forecast for {{ city }} for today and the next few days.
    parameters:
      - key: city
        input_type: string
        requirement: required
        description: city name
    extensions:
      - type: stdio
        name: weather
        cmd: uvx
        args:
          - mcp_weather@latest
        timeout: 300
    ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>things-to-do</summary>
    ```yaml
    # sub-recipes/things-to-do.yaml
    version: 1.0.0
    title: Things to do in a city
    description: Find activities and attractions for travelers
    instructions: You are a local travel expert who knows the best activities, attractions, and experiences in cities around the world.
    prompt: |
      Suggest the best things to do in {{ city }} for a {{ duration }} trip. 
      Include a mix of popular attractions, local experiences, and hidden gems.
      {% if weather_context %}
      Consider the weather conditions: {{ weather_context }}
      {% endif %}
    parameters:
      - key: city
        input_type: string
        requirement: required
        description: city name
      - key: duration
        input_type: string
        requirement: required
        description: trip duration (e.g., "2 days", "1 week")
      - key: weather_context
        input_type: string
        requirement: optional
        default: ""
        description: weather conditions to consider for activity recommendations
    ```
</details>

## Choosing Between Execution Modes

While parallel execution offers speed benefits, sequential execution is sometimes necessary or preferable. Here's how to decide:

**Use Sequential When:**
- Tasks modify shared resources
- Order of execution matters
- Memory or CPU constraints exist
- Debugging complex failures in parallel mode

**Use Parallel When:**
- Tasks are independent
- Faster completion is desired
- System resources can handle concurrent executions for up to 10 parallel workers
- Processing large datasets or multiple files

**Recipe-Level Configuration:**

For sub-recipes that should never run in parallel, set `sequential_when_repeated: true` to override user requests:

```yaml
sub_recipes:
  - name: database-migration
    path: "./sub-recipes/migrate.yaml"
    sequential_when_repeated: true  # Always sequential
```
